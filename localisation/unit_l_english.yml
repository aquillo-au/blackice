They were to become the Etna-class Italian AA cruisers of the Regia Marina but were never completed before the Italian armistice. They would have displaced 5,900 tons and been armed with six 152mm/53 OTO 1929 guns in their main armament. They would have had decent armor but would be fairly slow for a cruiser."
