 GER_Aufstellunfswelle_1_desc:0 "During World War II the German infantry divisions were, mostly, mobilized in “Wellen” (Waves) as they were required by the changing fortunes of war. Welle was the German designation for groups of infantry divisions raised at approximately the same time, with approximately the same type of organization and equipment, and that shared a similar type of personnel and level of training.\nFrom 1939 to 1945 there were at least 35 “Wellen” formed in the various 'Wehrkreise' (Military Districts), under the supervision of the 'Ersatzheer' (Replacement Army)."
 GER_2_l_div:0 " Form the 2. Leichte Division"
 GER_2_l_div_desc:0 "After Czechoslovakia was taken over by Germany, it was adopted by the German Army, seeing service in the invasions of Poland, France and Russia. Production ended in 1942, when its armament was deemed inadequate. In all, over 1400 were manufactured. The chassis continued to be produced for the Marder III (1942-1944) with some of its components used in the later Jagdpanzer 38 (1944-1945) tank destroyers, turretless assault guns, anti-tank guns and anti-aircraft guns.\nThe Panzer 38(t) performed well in the Polish Campaign in 1939 and the Battle of France in 1940. It was better armed than the Panzer I and Panzer II tanks. It was on a par with most light tank designs of the era, although it was unable to effectively engage the frontal armour of medium, heavy and infantry tank designs."
