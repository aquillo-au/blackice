 faq.1.desc:0 "PLEASE READ: Because HoI does not allow different ideologies to be in the same faction with each other, the alliance system was rewritten. The factions are still working, but they take time to fire the necessary events to add in everyone in wartime. So please be patient as the system works. \n\nFurthermore, due to the 1.4.1 patch breaking civil wars and coups for BICE, the boost party popularity/start coup mechanics have been disabled until further notice. \n\nThank you for your understanding!"

 faq.2.desc:0 "Q. Why do all my ministers disappear when my government changes? \n\nA: Not all ministers will work for opposing ideologies. An event will fire that removes all of your ministers and gives you 750 PP to choose from the new compatible cabinet. \n\nQ: I don't recognize _____ minister, is he ahistorical? Also, you're missing "insert historical minister here." \n\nAs we only have so much time to mod and research, some things get left behind. All countries should have generic ministers to fill in slots that don't have any historical ministers. We will try to add a new batch of ministers every so often, both for starting cabinets for additional ideologies. You can speed this process up by providing us with lists of ministers you would like to see added, preferably with the traits and party identification you think they should have."

 faq.3.desc:0 "There are several ways to change your country's government. It can happen naturally through ideological drift/events/subversion etc., it can happen through elections if support is high enough, through national focuses, and by advisors. \n\nAs many players will want to change their ideology as fast as possible, advisors are the best way to go. In your political advisor slots, there are a number of ministers who provide ideological drift for all the opposing ideologies. Pick your desired advisor and wait for the event chain to start."
