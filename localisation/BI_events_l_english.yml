The meeting marked a turning point in Hitler's foreign policies which then began to radicalize.  It outlined Hitler's plans for expansion in Europe.\n\nAccording to the Memorandum, Hitler did not want war in 1939 with Britain and France.  What he wanted was small wars of plunder to help support Germany's struggling economy.  Although the Nazis never let on about their financial problems.  Hitler wanted a full-scale European war with Britain and France between 1941-1944/45."

 news.2242.d:0 "The Blomberg-Fritsch Affair were two related scandals in early 1938 that resulted in the subjugation of the German Armed Forces by Hitler.  The affair started after the 12 January 1938 marriage of War Minister Werner von Blomberg when a policeman reported that his young bride had previously posed for pornographic photos.  Hitler ordered Blomberg to annul the marriage in order to avoid a scandal and to preserve the integrity of the army.  Blomberg refused to annul the marriage and when Goering threatened to make his wife's past public knowledge, Blomberg consequently resigned on 27 January 1938.  Goering did not want Fritsch to become the successor to Blomberg and thus his superior.  Himmler wanted to weaken the Wehrmacht in order to strengthen his Schutzstaffel as a competitor to the regular German Army.  Reinhard Heydrich had prepared a file on von Fritsch with allegations of homosexuality.  Fritsch resigned on 4 February 1938."

 news.2244.d:0 "Modern Times is a 1936 comedy film written and directed by Charlie Chaplin in which his iconic Little Tramp character struggles to survive in the modern, industrialized world. The film is a comment on the desperate employment and fiscal conditions many people faced during the Great Depression, conditions created, in Chaplin's view, by the efficiencies of modern industrialization.\n\nChaplin began preparing the film in 1934 as his first talkie, and went as far as writing a dialogue script and experimenting with some sound scenes. However, he soon abandoned these attempts and reverted to a silent format with synchronized sound effects. The dialogue experiments confirmed his long-standing conviction that the universal appeal of the Tramp would be lost if the character ever spoke on screen."

Schmeling had studied Louis' style, and in the days before the fight, he claimed to have found the key to victory - fans thought that he was just trying to raise interest in the fight. Nevertheless, boxing fans still wanted to see the rising star against the famed former world champion.\n\nAs rounds went by, Louis suffered various injuries, including one to the eye. Louis remained busy, trying to land a punch that would give him a knockout victory, but, with eyesight trouble and Schmeling's jab constantly in his face, this proved impossible.\n\nBy round twelve, Schmeling was far ahead on the judges' scorecards. Finally, he landed a right to Louis' body, followed by another right hand, this one to the jaw. Louis fell near his own corner, and was counted out by Donovan. This was Louis' only knockout defeat during his prime."

The term eventually became the standard designation for all intelligence from high-level cryptanalytic sources.  The name arose because the code-breaking was considered more important than the highest security classification available at the time, (Most Secret), and so was regarded as being Ultra secret.  Much of the German cipher traffic was encrypted on the Enigma machine, hence the term Ultra has often been used almost synonymously with "Enigma decrypts".  The high-level intelligence produced at Bletchley Park, codenamed Ultra, is credited with having provided crucial assistance to the Allied war effort and with having shortened the war, though Ultra's precise influence is still being studied and debated.

The British used this information as the foundation for their own early efforts to decrypt Enigma.  The first wave of the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS) moved to Bletchley Park on 15 August 1939.  The main body of GC&CS, including its Naval, Military and Air Sections, was situated on the ground floor, together with a telephone exchange, a teleprinter room, a kitchen and a dining room.  The top floor was allocated to MI6.  The prefabricated wooden huts were still being erected, and initially the entire "shooting party" was crowded into the existing house, its stables and cottages. These proved too small, so Elmers School, a neighbouring boys' boarding school, was acquired for the Commercial and Diplomatic Sections."

Bletchley Park is mainly remembered for breaking messages enciphered on the German Enigma machine, but its greatest cryptographic achievement may have been the breaking of the German Fish High Command teleprinter cyphers.

In April 1942 a plebiscite was held on the question, "Are you in favour of releasing the Government from any obligations arising out of any past commitments restricting the methods of raising men for military service?"\n\nThe plebiscite was supported by most English Canadians as well as the banned Communist Party of Canada which established Tim Buck "Yes" Committees to campaign for a yes vote. Across Canada, 64.5% of voters were in favour of conscription, with English Canadians voting 83% in favour. The proposal received hardly any support from French Canadians, especially in Quebec, where anti-conscription groups (including one led by Henri Bourassa, the most vocal opponent of conscription in 1917) convinced 72.9% of voters to oppose the plebiscite. The government then passed Bill 80, repealing the sections of the NRMA that did not allow for overseas conscription. However, many Canadians still did not support immediate conscription; there were a few riots in Montreal, although these were not on the same scale as the 1917 and 1918 riots. Even in Toronto, a strongly pro-conscription region, Conservative Arthur Meighen was defeated in a by-election after promising to help introduce conscription."

It began with a small guard unit known as the Saal-Schutz (Hall-Protection) made up of NSDAP volunteers to provide security for party meetings in Munich. From 1929 until the regime's collapse in 1945, the SS was the foremost agency of surveillance and terror within Germany and German-occupied Europe.  In November 1933, the name was changed to Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler. In April 1934, Himmler modified the name to Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler (LSSAH). The LSSAH guarded Hitler's private residences and offices, providing an outer ring of protection for the Führer and his visitors. LSSAH men manned sentry posts at the entrances to the old Reich Chancellery and the new Reich Chancellery.[74] The number of LSSAH guards was increased during special events. At the Berghof, Hitler's residence in the Obersalzberg, a large contingent of the LSSAH patrolled an extensive cordoned security zone."

On 26 June 1933, Himmler appointed SS-Oberführer Theodor Eicke as commandant of Dachau concentration camp, one of the first Nazi concentration camps. It was created to consolidate the many small camps that had been set up by various police agencies and the NSDAP to house political prisoners. The organizational structure Eicke instituted at Dachau stood as the model for all later concentration camps. After 1934, Eicke was named commander of the SS-Totenkopfverbände (SS-TV), the SS formation responsible for running the concentration camps under the authority of the SS and Himmler. Known as the "Death's Head Units", the SS-TV was first organized as several battalions, each based at one of Germany's major concentration camps. Leadership at the camps was divided into five departments: commander and adjutant, political affairs division, protective custody, administration, and medical personnel. By 1935, Himmler secured Hitler's approval and the finances necessary to establish and operate additional camps.[92] Six concentration camps[a] housing 21,400 inmates (mostly political prisoners) existed at the start of the war in September 1939. By the end of the war, hundreds of camps of varying size and function had been created, holding nearly 715,000 people, most of whom were targeted by the regime because of their race. The concentration camp population rose in tandem with the defeats suffered by the Nazi regime; the worse the catastrophe seemed, the greater the fear of subversion, prompting the SS to intensify their repression and terror."

Each regiment would contain three battalions, a motorcycle company and mortar company.\nThe existence of the SS-Verfügungstruppe (SS-VT) was publicly declared on 16 March 1935 by Hitler in a speech at the Reichstag. The SS-VT had to depend on the German Army for its supply of weapons and military training, and they had control of the recruiting system through local draft boards responsible for assigning conscripts to the different branches of the Wehrmacht to meet quotas set by the German High Command (Oberkommando der Wehrmacht or OKW in German).

Recruits were required to have perfect teeth and eyesight and provide a medical certificate. By 1938 the height restrictions were relaxed, up to six dental fillings were permitted, and eyeglasses for astigmatism and mild vision correction were allowed. Once World War II in Europe commenced, the physical requirements were no longer strictly enforced, and essentially any recruit who could pass a basic medical exam was considered for Waffen-SS service. Following the campaign in the West in 1940, Hitler authorized the enlistment of "people perceived to be of related stock", as Himmler put it, to expand the ranks. A number of Danes, Dutch, Norwegians, Swedes and Finns volunteered to fight in the Waffen-SS under the command of German officers. Non-Germanic units were not considered to be part of the SS directly, which still maintained its strict racial criteria, but rather were considered to be foreign nationals serving under the command of the SS."

Royalists have always, and likely will always, be around, but this year things seem to be different. There's a new energy within the Royalist movement, one that could turn take this ideology out of the shadows and into mainstream politics. \n\nThe question remains: are the [Root.GetAdjective] people ready for monarchism?"
 political.30.a:0 "There may be those in the government itself who support such ideas."
 political.30.a.tt:0 "Increases the chance of internal support for a monarchist coup."

Rumors continue to spread of the many Royalist sympathizers within the ranks of the [Root.GetRulingParty], despite the best efforts of party elders to stamp them out. \n\nThese secret supporters have been quietly lobbying for making compromises with the Royalists in the hopes of avoiding future calamity, or at least keep any sort of change as bloodless as possible."

Royalists around the country, realizing what was happening, took to the streets in support of this bold action, lending valuable credibility and authority to their actions at a critical juncture. Seemingly without the support of the public or the military, the [Root.GetLeader] government has been completely ousted from power. \n\nWhile the coup is still on going, it is safe to say that {Root.GetName] is in store for some wild times ahead."

They rail against the [Root.GetLeader] government's failures and scandals, claiming that a monarchy would never debase itself in such a manner. \n\nEven worse, they are actively calling for people across the nation to resist the authority of the current government, advocating for a passive resistance in the name of bringing down the [Root.GetRulingParty].

Particularly following the Beveridge Report's release in 1942, which expected post-war governments to become much more involved in the economy in order to improve social welfare, the Labour platform has become quite popular among the voters, making a Conservative victory in the upcoming election increasingly unlikely."

Beveridge propses a series of widespread reforms to the system of social welfare, many of which are proving highly popular among the voters. Many Conservative leaders, who may agree somewhat in principle that some smaller measures must be taken, are certainly not committed to such a massive financial endeavor. This report will likely come to be a major issue in the post-war election."

 germany.302.t:0 "Who will be Kaiser?"
 germany.302.desc:0 "With the restoration of the Hohenzollern monarchy, the time has come to decide who will sit on the throne; by no means an easy task. \n\nOn the one hand, we have Kronprinz Wilhelm, technically the rightful heir to the German throne as the eldest son of Wilhelm II. However, the Great War still weighs heavily in the minds of the people. The Kronprinz did not cover himself in glory at the battle of Verdun and is fairly unpopular. Nevertheless, he would be in favor of a stronger, more centralized monarchy, granting the government more power. \n\nOn the other hand, his son Prince Louis Ferdinand, by all accounts a bright and popular young man, is a suitable choice as well. He is more willing to compromise with the democratic parties and does not have the shadow of the Great War hanging over him. He may initially struggle in his rule, however. \n\nWho shall rule the German Reich?"
 germany.302.a:0 "The Kronprinz is the rightful heir."
 germany.302.b:0 "Prince Louis Ferdinand is the more sensible choice."
 germany.303.t:0 "Who will be Chancellor?"
 germany.303.desc:0 "Now that the Kaiser is chosen, we must decide who will be Chancellor. This question rests on what the Kaiser needs most: political influence, popularity, a more modern look, or power unto himself. \n\nFranz von Papen, while deeply unpopular due to his disdain for commoners and his economic policies, is a committed monarchist and is very well connected amongst the elite. \n\nPaul von Lettow-Vorbeck, the Great War hero, is also a great candidate due to his immense popularity with the people. However, his skills in the smoke-filled rooms of politics may not live up to his skills on the battlfield. \n\nHans-Jürgen von Blumenthal, as a third option, is a rising star on the Right. He's a major force within the German National People's Party and is often considered to be the future of the monarchist movement. He could be very useful should he survive the initial years. \n\nFinally, we could simply abolish the position altogether and centralize all authority in the Throne."
