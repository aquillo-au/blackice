 news.2242.d:0 "The Blomberg-Fritsch Affair were two related scandals in early 1938 that resulted in the subjugation of the German Armed Forces by Hitler.  The affair started after the 12 January 1938 marriage of War Minister Werner von Blomberg when a policeman reported that his young bride had previously posed for pornographic photos.  Hitler ordered Blomberg to annul the marriage in order to avoid a scandal and to preserve the integrity of the army.  Blomberg refused to annul the marriage and when Goering threatened to make his wife's past public knowledge, Blomberg consequently resigned on 27 January 1938.  Goering did not want Fritsch to become the successor to Blomberg and thus his superior.  Himmler wanted to weaken the Wehrmacht in order to strengthen his Schutzstaffel as a competitor to the regular German Army.  Reinhard Heydrich had prepared a file on von Fritsch with allegations of homosexuality.  Fritsch resigned on 4 February 1938."

 news.2244.d:0 "Modern Times is a 1936 comedy film written and directed by Charlie Chaplin in which his iconic Little Tramp character struggles to survive in the modern, industrialized world. The film is a comment on the desperate employment and fiscal conditions many people faced during the Great Depression, conditions created, in Chaplin's view, by the efficiencies of modern industrialization.\n\nChaplin began preparing the film in 1934 as his first talkie, and went as far as writing a dialogue script and experimenting with some sound scenes. However, he soon abandoned these attempts and reverted to a silent format with synchronized sound effects. The dialogue experiments confirmed his long-standing conviction that the universal appeal of the Tramp would be lost if the character ever spoke on screen."

Nevertheless, boxing fans still wanted to see the rising star against the famed former world champion.\n\nAs rounds went by, Louis suffered various injuries, including one to the eye. Louis remained busy, trying to land a punch that would give him a knockout victory, but, with eyesight trouble and Schmeling's jab constantly in his face, this proved impossible.\n\nBy round twelve, Schmeling was far ahead on the judges' scorecards. Finally, he landed a right to Louis' body, followed by another right hand, this one to the jaw. Louis fell near his own corner, and was counted out by Donovan. This was Louis' only knockout defeat during his prime."

The British used this information as the foundation for their own early efforts to decrypt Enigma.  The first wave of the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS) moved to Bletchley Park on 15 August 1939.  The main body of GC&CS, including its Naval, Military and Air Sections, was situated on the ground floor, together with a telephone exchange, a teleprinter room, a kitchen and a dining room.  The top floor was allocated to MI6.  The prefabricated wooden huts were still being erected, and initially the entire "shooting party" was crowded into the existing house, its stables and cottages.

In April 1942 a plebiscite was held on the question, "Are you in favour of releasing the Government from any obligations arising out of any past commitments restricting the methods of raising men for military service?"\n\nThe plebiscite was supported by most English Canadians as well as the banned Communist Party of Canada which established Tim Buck "Yes" Committees to campaign for a yes vote. Across Canada, 64.5% of voters were in favour of conscription, with English Canadians voting 83% in favour. The proposal received hardly any support from French Canadians, especially in Quebec, where anti-conscription groups (including one led by Henri Bourassa, the most vocal opponent of conscription in 1917) convinced 72.9% of voters to oppose the plebiscite. The government then passed Bill 80, repealing the sections of the NRMA that did not allow for overseas conscription. However, many Canadians still did not support immediate conscription; there were a few riots in Montreal, although these were not on the same scale as the 1917 and 1918 riots. Even in Toronto, a strongly pro-conscription region, Conservative Arthur Meighen was defeated in a by-election after promising to help introduce conscription."

The aircraft was used for maritime patrols and reconnaissance, searching for Allied convoys and warships that could be reported for targeting by U-boats. The Fw 200 could also carry a 900-kilogram (2,000 lb) bomb load or naval mines to use against shipping, and it was claimed that from June 1940 to February 1941, they sank 331,122 tonnes (365,000 tons) of shipping despite a rather crude bombsight. The attacks were carried out at extremely low altitude in order to "bracket" the target ship with three bombs; this almost guaranteed a hit. Winston Churchill called the Fw 200 the "Scourge of the Atlantic" during the Battle of the Atlantic due to its contribution to the heavy Allied shipping losses."

In November 1933, the name was changed to Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler. In April 1934, Himmler modified the name to Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler (LSSAH). The LSSAH guarded Hitler's private residences and offices, providing an outer ring of protection for the Führer and his visitors.

On 26 June 1933, Himmler appointed SS-Oberführer Theodor Eicke as commandant of Dachau concentration camp, one of the first Nazi concentration camps. It was created to consolidate the many small camps that had been set up by various police agencies and the NSDAP to house political prisoners. The organizational structure Eicke instituted at Dachau stood as the model for all later concentration camps. After 1934, Eicke was named commander of the SS-Totenkopfverbände (SS-TV), the SS formation responsible for running the concentration camps under the authority of the SS and Himmler. Known as the "Death's Head Units", the SS-TV was first organized as several battalions, each based at one of Germany's major concentration camps. Leadership at the camps was divided into five departments: commander and adjutant, political affairs division, protective custody, administration, and medical personnel. By 1935, Himmler secured Hitler's approval and the finances necessary to establish and operate additional camps.[92] Six concentration camps[a] housing 21,400 inmates (mostly political prisoners) existed at the start of the war in September 1939. By the end of the war, hundreds of camps of varying size and function had been created, holding nearly 715,000 people, most of whom were targeted by the regime because of their race. The concentration camp population rose in tandem with the defeats suffered by the Nazi regime; the worse the catastrophe seemed, the greater the fear of subversion, prompting the SS to intensify their repression and terror."

Each regiment would contain three battalions, a motorcycle company and mortar company.\nThe existence of the SS-Verfügungstruppe (SS-VT) was publicly declared on 16 March 1935 by Hitler in a speech at the Reichstag. The SS-VT had to depend on the German Army for its supply of weapons and military training, and they had control of the recruiting system through local draft boards responsible for assigning conscripts to the different branches of the Wehrmacht to meet quotas set by the German High Command (Oberkommando der Wehrmacht or OKW in German).

Recruits were required to have perfect teeth and eyesight and provide a medical certificate. By 1938 the height restrictions were relaxed, up to six dental fillings were permitted, and eyeglasses for astigmatism and mild vision correction were allowed. Once World War II in Europe commenced, the physical requirements were no longer strictly enforced, and essentially any recruit who could pass a basic medical exam was considered for Waffen-SS service. Following the campaign in the West in 1940, Hitler authorized the enlistment of "people perceived to be of related stock", as Himmler put it, to expand the ranks. A number of Danes, Dutch, Norwegians, Swedes and Finns volunteered to fight in the Waffen-SS under the command of German officers. Non-Germanic units were not considered to be part of the SS directly, which still maintained its strict racial criteria, but rather were considered to be foreign nationals serving under the command of the SS."

 worldnews.5.d:0 "France is proud to launch with great fanfare the Universal Exhibition of 1937. In Paris, over 101 hectares, 44 countries showcase their pavilions around the themes of arts and techniques applied to modern life. Nearly 32 million visitors will rush to come. At the time, Paris will retain the Chaillot Palace, the Palace of Discovery, and the Palais de Tokyo. The spirit of new modern art triumphs everywhere. The world wants to believe for a moment that the exhibition will finally bring together everything that unites men. But circumstances have placed the monumental Soviet and German pavilions across from each other. This will lead to them challenging each other: one with a twenty-five meter statue of the Worker and the Kolkhoz Woman brandishing a sickle and a hammer; the other a monumental sculpture of an eagle holding a swastika in its talons."

This system includes a lot of new systems and events that help spice up the daily operation of your country, including dissent, political repression, corruption/scandals, coups, assassinations, and many others. \n\nAlmost all of these events will add/subtract political power or party popularity, and may cause changes to your laws or even change the government. \n\nNaturally, this means that while measures have been taken to make sure nothing too crazy happens on historical focus, a completely historical playthrough is not guaranteed. If you would like to experience this, select the second option. If you prefer something closer to the pure historical situation, select the first option. \n\nTake note: If historical focus is on, you will not be able to flip other countries' governments through subversion, as the AI has its own event for managing ahistorical ideologies.

He was succeeded by Joachim von Ribbentrop, but remained in government as a minister without portfolio to allay the concerns that his removal would have caused internationally.

 political.30.t:0 "Monarchism on the Rise"
 political.30.desc:0 "The idea of a monarchy in [Root.GetName] has never really died, no matter how long ago it may have been. Royalists have always, and likely will always, be around, but this year things seem to be different. There's a new energy within the Royalist movement, one that could turn take this ideology out of the shadows and into mainstream politics. \n\nThe question remains: are the [Root.GetAdjective] people ready for monarchism?"
 political.30.a:0 "There may be those in the government itself who support such ideas."
 political.30.a.tt:0 "Increases the chance of internal support for a monarchist coup."

 political.30.b.tt:0 "Increases the chance of popular support for a monarchist revolution."
 political.31.t:0 "Monarchist Sympathies in Government"
 political.31.desc:0 "While certainly the [Root.GetLeader] government is no friend to the monarchists, the same cannot be said for all of their ministers. Rumors continue to spread of the many Royalist sympathizers within the ranks of the [Root.GetRulingParty], despite the best efforts of party elders to stamp them out. \n\nThese secret supporters have been quietly lobbying for making compromises with the Royalists in the hopes of avoiding future calamity, or at least keep any sort of change as bloodless as possible."
 political.31.a:0 "This could lead to something extraordinary."
 political.31.a.tt:0 "If public support is sufficient, a coup can be executed."
 political.32.t:0 "Monarchists Execute Coup"
 political.32.desc:0 "Today is a day that will live long in the memories of the [Root.GetAdjective] people. In a stunning turn of events, the Royalists have managed to outmanuever the [Root.GetLeader] government and place them under arrest! \n\nWell placed ministers and officers within the [Root.GetRulingParty] government and [Root.GetAdjective] military seized on the chaos to arrest or silence loyalists throughout the capitol and major cities. Royalists around the country, realizing what was happening, took to the streets in support of this bold action, lending valuable credibility and authority to their actions at a critical juncture. Seemingly without the support of the public or the military, the [Root.GetLeader] government has been completely ousted from power. \n\nWhile the coup is still on going, it is safe to say that {Root.GetName] is in store for some wild times ahead."

They rail against the [Root.GetLeader] government's failures and scandals, claiming that a monarchy would never debase itself in such a manner. \n\nEven worse, they are actively calling for people across the nation to resist the authority of the current government, advocating for a passive resistance in the name of bringing down the [Root.GetRulingParty]. It is hard to say what the ultimate consequences of this will be, but the country has not been this divided in quite some time."

The Allies eventually captured the capital, Tananarive, without much opposition, and then the town of Ambalavao. The last major action was at Andramanalina on 18 October. An armistice was signed in Ambalavao on 6 November, and Annet surrendered near Ihosy, in the south of the island, on 8 November 1942."

It marked the end of the Vichy regime as a nominally-independent state and the disbandment of its army (the severely-limited Armistice Army), but it continued its existence as a puppet government in Occupied France. One of the last actions of its armed forces before their dissolution was the scuttling of the French fleet in Toulon to prevent it from falling into Axis hands."

 blackicenavalevents.1.t:0 "The Hiryū-class aircraft carrier"
 blackicenavalevents.1.d:0 "The naval construction bureau has finished the development of the Hiryū-class aircraft carrier. The IJN Sōryū ("Blue Dragon") and IJN Hiryū ("Flying Dragon") were designed with mirrored island superstructure to speed up aircraft recovery processes while sailing next to each other. They were fast carriers with room for large air groups, but minimally armored. They displaced 20.000tons and large engines provided high speed and a long range of operations. These were the first modern aircraft carriers of the Imperial Japanese Navy and the platform further aircraft carrier development was based on."

 blackicenavalevents.2.d:0 "The naval construction bureau has finished the development of the Shōkaku-class aircraft carrier. The two Shōkaku-class carriers Shōkaku ("Soaring Crane") and Zuikaku ("Auspicious Crane") were ordered in 1937 as part of the 3rd Naval Armaments Supplement Program. Completed shortly before the start of the Pacific War in 1941, they have been called "arguably the best aircraft carriers in the world" when built. The Shōkaku-class carriers were initially intended to have an air group of 96, including 24 aircraft in reserve. All of these aircraft were either superseded by larger, more modern aircraft or cancelled while the ships were being built, so the air group was revised for a totla of 84 aircraft."

 blackicenavalevents.3.d:0 "The naval construction bureau has finished the development of the Shinano-class aircraft carrier. The IJN Shinano was laid down as one of the three Yamato-class super heavy battleships. After the disastrous loss of four fleet carriers in the Battle of Midway, the Imperial Japanese Navy ordered the ship's unfinished hull (45% construction completed) converted into an aircraft carrier. The Shinano featured the heaviest anti aircraft armament of all IJN carriers, heavy armor protection and was the very first carrier of the IJN to have a full amored flight deck, thanks to its Yamato-class legacy. The Shinano-class carried a huge air group of 120 aircrafts. The Imperial Japanese Navy decided that carriers of the heavily armored Shinano class would either serve as a support carrier or floating battle fortress at the frontline for the Combined Fleets battle line."

 blackicenavalevents.4.d:0 "The naval construction bureau has finished the development of the Taihō-class aircraft carrier. The IJN Taihō ("Great Phoenix") was approved for construction in the 1939 4th Supplementary Programme. Her design was that of a modified Shōkaku with slightly reduced speed but stronger hull and armor protection. Under the Modified Fleet Replenishment Program of 1942, Taihō was to be the first of a new generation of Japanese aircraft carriers featuring a amored flight deck and better overall armor protection against dive bombers and was expected to not only survive multiple bomb, torpedo, or shell hits, but also continue fighting effectively afterwards. Also the anti aircraft armement was significantly increased. After the launch of the IJN Taiho, it became almost immideatly the flagship of the Combined Fleet."

 blackicenavalevents.5.d:0 "The naval construction bureau has finished the development of the Hiyō-class aircraft carrier. The two Hiyō-class aircraft carriers were built for the Imperial Japanese Navy during World War II. Both ships of the class, Hiyō ("Flying Hawk") and Jun'yō ("Peregrine Falcon"), were originally laid down as luxury passenger liners before being acquired by the IJN for conversion to aircraft carriers in 1941. Their air group was originally intended to consist of 12 Mitsubishi A5M "Claude" fighters, plus 4 in storage, 18 Aichi D3A "Val" dive bombers, with an additional 2 in reserve, and 18 Nakajima B5N "Kate" torpedo bombers. This was revised to substitute a dozen Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighters, plus 3 in storage, for the A5Ms by the time the ship commissioned in 1942."

 blackicenavalevents.6.d:0 "The naval construction bureau has finished the development of the Unryū-class aircraft carrier. In the lead-up to the Pacific War the Imperial Japanese Navy attempted to build a large number of fleet carriers, in fact 16. The lead ship was IJN Unryū ("Cloud Dragon") For them to be built quickly, the design for these ships was based on the aircraft carrier Hiryū rather than the newer and more sophisticated Taihō or the Shōkaku class. The Unryū-class aircraft carrier design was very similar to that of Hiryū. The ships were lightly built, and the main difference from Hiryū was that the carriers' island was placed on the starboard side of the ships. The carriers were capable of carrying 63 aircraft in two hangars, and were fitted with two elevators."

The IJN Yamato and the IJN Musashi were designed to be the pride and might of the Imperial Japanese Navy under the Peace Goddesses plan. Each ship carried nine 460-millimetre naval guns, the largest naval artillery ever fitted to a warship. The two battleships of the class were completed, while a third (Shinano) was converted to an aircraft carrier during construction as naval aviation was more prioritized than heavy battleships."

The Casablanca-class escort carriers are the most numerous class of aircraft carriers ever built. Fifty were laid down, launched and commissioned within the space of less than two years – 3 November 1942 through to 8 July 1944. These were nearly one third of the 151 carriers built in the United States during the war. It had a larger and more useful hangar deck than previous conversions. It also had a larger flight deck than the Bogue class. Unlike larger carriers which had extensive armor, protection was limited to splinter plating and therefore the carrier design was very vulnerable."
