 JAP_destroyer_1h_desc:0 "The Hatsuharu-class destroyers were designed to accompany the Japanese main striking force and to conduct both day and night torpedo attacks against the United States Navy as it advanced across the Pacific Ocean, according to Japan's naval strategic projections. They were to be armed much as the Fubuki class despite displacing only 1400 tons compared to the 1700 tons of the earlier destroyers. Furthermore, their fire control systems were to be more modern than the older systems and suitable for anti-aircraft use."

As with the Hatsuharu class, the Shiratsuyu-class destroyers were designed to accompany the Japanese main striking force and to conduct both day and night torpedo attacks against the United States Navy as it advanced across the Pacific Ocean, according to Japanese naval strategic projections. Despite being one of the most powerful classes of destroyers in the world at the time of their completion, none survived the Pacific War. The Shiratsuyu class were the first Japanese warships to be completed with quadruple torpedo mounts and telephone communications to the torpedo station."
 JAP_destroyer_2:0 "Asashio Class DD II"

 JAP_destroyer_3:0 "Kagerō Class DD III"
 JAP_destroyer_3_desc:0 "The Kagerō class was an enlarged and improved version of the preceding Asashio class. At the time of introduction, these destroyers were among the most deadly destroyers afloat, primarily due to the excellent range and lethality of its "Long Lance" torpedo. Only the lack of radar hindered their otherwise superb design. As with most pre-World War II ships, Kagerōs were also deficient in anti-submarine and anti-aircraft weaponry as designed."
 JAP_destroyer_3b:0 "Akizuki Class DD IIIb"
 JAP_destroyer_3b_desc:0 "The Akizuki class destroyers were well-armed with both surface guns and torpedoes, adequate AA armament, as well as much needed extra depth charges. Out of the 39 planned only 12 were completed before the series was cancelled. They were designed to fight smaller ships, aircraft and submarines and considered to have been the most useful class of destroyers Japan fielded during the war and was well regarded in the IJN."

 JAP_destroyer_4:0 "Shimakaze Class DD IV"
 JAP_destroyer_4_desc:0 "The Shimakaze class and his only ship Shimakaze ("Island Wind" was the fastest destroyer in the world at the time of its completion. It was a prototype destroyer to test out new high-temperature, high-pressure turbines. It was extremely fast and heavily armed with torpedoes, but this meant a smaller radius of operations."
 JAP_destroyer_4b:0 "Fuyutsuki Class DD IVb"
 JAP_destroyer_4b_desc:0 "The Fuyutsuki subclass were originally going to be built to the same specifications as the Akizuki class but construction was more simplified. Four vessels were built under the Maru KyÅ« Programme. Main differences from the Akizuki class were simplified bow design, removed rear deck house, and fitted two-dimensional air inlet for boilers."
 JAP_destroyer_4c:0 "Matsu Class DD IVc"
 JAP_destroyer_4c_desc:0 "The Matsu class were built late in World War II, and they were intended to be more cost-effective in response to the changing character of naval warfare at that time. These ships were lighter and smaller than previous Japanese destroyers, with different armament such as enhanced anti-aircraft guns and anti-submarine weapons, and radar. Since surface warfare was believed to be less likely at this stage of the war, armament such as torpedo tubes that would be useful against surface ships was reduced."
 JAP_destroyer_5:0 "Michitsuki Class DD V"
 JAP_destroyer_5_desc:0 "Final production model of the Akizuki class even more simplified design version of Fuyutsuki class and fast and cheap in production. The Michitsuki featured the most heavy anti aircraft armament fitted on a destroyer design within the Imperial Japanese Navy."
 JAP_destroyer_5b:0 "Tachibana Class DD Vb"

In August 1941 the ships of the class were to undergo a conversion to torpedo cruisers to form a special torpedo attack squadron for the Combined Fleet. Up to 40 torpedo launchers fitted with the deadly long lance torpeod were installed and the cruisers originial main armament was removed for that. This design resulted in a costly but extreme deadly torpedo platform weapon, once the cruiser gets into range to launch their torpedos."

 JAP_light_cruiser_2:0 "Katori Class CL II"
 JAP_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "Originally ordered by the IJN in the 1937 and 1939 Supplementary Naval budgets, the Katori-class cruisers were purpose-designed to replace the aging armored cruisers in the officer training role, and as such differed from other IJN cruisers in several aspects. Unusually for IJN ships, the Katori class had mixed steam turbine/diesel propulsion, intended to maximize the ships' instructional value rather than speed: even at a combined 8000 shp the maximum speed was only 18 knots, too slow for conventional cruiser duties."

 JAP_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The design for the Agano class was based on technologies developed by aboard the cruiser Yūbari, resulting in a graceful and uncluttered deck line and single smokestack. Unlike most Japanese designs, the Agano class was not overweight, so it exhibited good stability and seaworthiness. The Agano class was unique among Japanese cruisers in that its main armament could elevate to 55 degrees, but this was still not enough to make them effective as anti-aircraft weapons."
 JAP_light_cruiser_3b:0 "Ōyodo Class CL IIIb"
 JAP_light_cruiser_3b_desc:0 "The Ōyodo design was as an enlarged and improved version of the Agano-class cruiser. Ōyodo retained the same general hull design as the cruiser Agano, with a flush deck and bulbous bow: however, her armament differed both in layout and weaponry, and her armour protection was reduced."
 JAP_light_cruiser_4:0 "Agatsuma Class CL IV"
 JAP_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Agatsuma class was light cruiser class that never saw any ships built before the end of the war. The cruisers were designed to be fast and heavily armed but light-armored, to protect the fleets and carriers against enemy aircraft." ### CA ###

 JAP_heavy_cruiser_2d_desc:0 "The Mogami class were four cruisers built for the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) during the 1930s and was one of the backbones of the IJN heavy cruiser fleet. They were initially classified as light cruisers under the weight and armament restrictions of the London Naval Treaty. After Japan refused to comply any longer with that agreement, all four ships were rearmed with larger guns and were reclassified as heavy cruisers. The Mogami class consists of the ships Mogami, Mikuma, Suzuya and Kumano and had heavy dual purpose main batteries of five 155 mm (6.1 in) triple turrets and turreted torpedo launchers."
 JAP_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Tone Class CA III"
 JAP_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The two Tone-class cruisers were the last heavy cruisers completed for the Imperial Japanese Navy. The Tone-class cruisers had a very distinctive silhouette, with all main armament concentrated forward and the aft section entirely devoted to aircraft operations. This allowed for strong and compact protection of the magazines while also increasing and improving the living quarters aft. The Tone and the Chikuma were intended to provide the long range reconnaissance needed for Japan's carrier Air Fleets."
 JAP_aviation_cruiser_1:0 "Mogami Kai Class"
 JAP_aviation_cruiser_1_desc:0 "During 1940, all Mogami class cruisers underwent an modernization program that replaced the main armament of 5x3 155mm(6.1 inch) by 5x2 203mm (8 inch) turrets and additional 15x triple mounts of 25mm anit-aircraft armament was fitted. In order to increase further scouting capabilities for the Combined Fleet, the number of scout aircrafts was increased to 11 seaplanes and new radar equipment was installed as well making the Mogami Kai class one of the finest and deadliest heavy cruisers in the entire pacifc."
 JAP_aviation_cruiser_2:0 "Takao Kai Class"
 JAP_aviation_cruiser_2_desc:0 "After the modernization of Mogami class cruiser, the IJN began as well to upgrade the rest of its heavy cruiser fleet. This resulted in upgraded versions of the Takao class and Tone class cruisers. Similar to the Mogami Kai class, additional 25mm caliber mounts in double and triple design were fitted to the cruisers to increase anti-aircraft protection as well as new radar equipment and additional armor protection. This resulted in a heavy cruiser design that was more than ever ready to face the challenges of the pacifc theater.

 JAP_fast_battleship_1:0 "Kongō Class FBB I"
 JAP_fast_battleship_1_desc:0 "The design of the Kongō-class battlecruisers came about as a result of the IJN's modernization programs, as well as the perceived need to compete with the British Royal Navy. Under the terms of the contract signed with Vickers in November 1910, one member of the Kongō class, the lead ship Kongō was to be built in Britain and Vickers were to maximize technology transfer to Japan. Following Japan's withdrawal from the London Naval Treaty, all four underwent a massive second reconstruction in the late 1930s. Following the completion of these modifications, which increased top speeds to over 30 knots (56 km/h; 35 mph), all four were reclassified as fast battleships"

 JAP_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Fusō class battleships were built during WWI and modernized in the 1930's when the 1st London Naval Treaty banned construction of new battleships for the signatories. They were well-armored and armed, with the 6 twin turrets on the centerline giving a heavy broadside, but also limiting the extra AA weaponry these ships could carry."
 JAP_battleship_1b:0 "Ise Class BB Ib"
 JAP_battleship_1b_desc:0 "Ise was the lead ship of the two-vessel Ise-class battleship of the Imperial Japanese Navy. Originally planned to be the third Fusō-class battleship, experience gained in the construction of the Fusō class revealed a number of design issues, including weak armament and protection, which forced a redesign and new classification. Despite these efforts at modernization and upgrading, Ise was still considered obsolete by the start of the Pacific War due to her relatively slow speed, large crew, and short range, and never saw combat as a battleship."
 JAP_battleship_2:0 "Kii Class BB II"
 JAP_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Kii class were to be Japan's first true fast battleships.  More heavily armoured than contemporary battlecruisers, but similarly as fast. They weren't built due to the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922, and when Japan did recommence battleship construction, they opted for the super-heavy Yamato class."
 JAP_battleship_2b:0 "Nagato Class BB IIb"
 JAP_battleship_2b_desc:0 "The IJN considered a battle fleet of eight modern battleships and eight modern armored cruisers necessary for the defense of Japan, and the government adopted that policy in 1907. This was the genesis of the Eight-Eight Fleet Program, the development of a cohesive battle line of 16 capital ships less than eight years old. Although the United States Navy planned to arm its Colorado class with 16-inch (406 mm) guns before the Nagato class was designed, Nagato's 410-millimeter (16.1 in) guns made her the first dreadnought that was launched armed with guns larger than 15 inches (381 mm). During their 1934-36 reconstruction, the ships' sterns were lengthened by 7.55 meters (24.8 ft) to improve their speed and their forward superstructures were rebuilt into a pagoda mast. They were given torpedo bulges to improve their underwater protection and to compensate for the weight of the additional armor and equipment."
 JAP_battleship_3:0 "Tajima Class BB III"
 JAP_battleship_3_desc:0 "The Tajima class was a hypothetical class of fast battleships, designed to be cheaper and faster to build than the massive Yamato class battleships.

 JAP_battleship_4:0 "Iwami Class BB IV"
 JAP_battleship_4_desc:0 "The Iwami class was a hypothetical class of battleships, that utilized new methods to speed up construction. They were well-armed with new cannons and heavy AA guns, and could match any similarly armed vessels for firepower. However, the resulting improvements meant a heavier and thus somewhat slower class of ships."
 JAP_SH_battleship_1:0 "Yamato Class SBB I"
 JAP_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Yamato class consisted of the heaviest battleships ever created, displacing 72,000 tons, and the ships were designed to be the pride and might of the Japanese navy under the Peace Goddesses plan. Each ship carried nine 460-millimetre naval guns, the largest naval artillery ever fitted to a warship. Two battleships of the class (Yamato and Musashi) were completed, while a third (Shinano) was converted to an aircraft carrier during construction."

 JAP_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The hypothetical Super Yamato class saw the Yamato was used as a base, but the weapons would be even stronger with a main armament of 51cm cannons and a strong AA armament of the newest type. Their armor thickness was designed to withstand even shells from its own cannons, and they would displace around 70-80.000tons."
 JAP_carrier_1:0 "Akagi Class CV I"
 JAP_carrier_1_desc:0 "Akagi ("Red Castle") was an aircraft carrier built for the Imperial Japanese Navy. Though she was laid down as an Amagi-class battlecruiser, Akagi was converted to an aircraft carrier while still under construction to comply with the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty. The ship was rebuilt from 1935 to 1938 with her original three flight decks consolidated into a single enlarged flight deck and an island superstructure. The second Japanese aircraft carrier to enter service, and the first large or "fleet" carrier, Akagi figured prominently in the development of the IJN's new carrier striking force doctrine that grouped carriers together, concentrating their air power."
 JAP_carrier_1b:0 "Kaga Class CV Ib"
 JAP_carrier_1b_desc:0 "The aircraft carrier Kaga was Japan's first fleet carrier. She was originally a battleship, but finished as an aircraft carrier.

Completed shortly before the start of the Pacific War in 1941, they have been called "arguably the best aircraft carriers in the world" when built. The Shōkaku-class carriers were initially intended to have an air group of 96, including 24 aircraft in reserve. All of these aircraft were either superseded by larger, more modern aircraft or cancelled while the ships were being built, so the air group was revised for a totla of 84 aircraft."
 JAP_carrier_3b:0 "Taihō Class CV IIIb"
 JAP_carrier_3b_desc:0 "Taihō ("Great Phoenix") was approved for construction in the 1939 4th Supplementary Programme. Her design was that of a modified Shōkaku with slightly reduced speed but stronger hull and armor protection. Under the Modified Fleet Replenishment Program of 1942, Taihō was to be the first of a new generation of Japanese aircraft carriers featuring a amored flight deck and better overall armor protection against dive bombers and was expected to not only survive multiple bomb, torpedo, or shell hits, but also continue fighting effectively afterwards. Also the anti aircraft armement was significantly increased. After the launch of the IJN Taiho, it became almost immideatly the flagship of the Combined Fleet."
 JAP_carrier_4:0 "Unryū Class CV IV"
 JAP_carrier_4_desc:0 "In the lead-up to the Pacific War the Imperial Japanese Navy attempted to build a large number of fleet carriers, in fact 16. The lead ship was IJN Unryū ("Cloud Dragon") For them to be built quickly, the design for these ships was based on the aircraft carrier Hiryū rather than the newer and more sophisticated Taihō or the Shōkaku class. The Unryū-class aircraft carrier design was very similar to that of Hiryū. The ships were lightly built, and the main difference from Hiryū was that the carriers' island was placed on the starboard side of the ships. The carriers were capable of carrying 63 aircraft in two hangars, and were fitted with two elevators."
 JAP_scarrier_1:0 "Shinano Class CVB I"
 JAP_scarrier_1_desc:0 "The IJN Shinano was laid down as one of the three Yamato-class super heavy battleships. After the disastrous loss of four fleet carriers in the Battle of Midway, the Imperial Japanese Navy ordered the ship's unfinished hull (45% construction completed) converted into an aircraft carrier. The Shinano featured the heaviest anti aircraft armament of all IJN carriers, heavy armor protection and was the very first carrier of the IJN to have a full amored flight deck, thanks to its Yamato-class legacy. The Shinano-class carried a huge air group of 120 aircrafts. The Imperial Japanese Navy decided that carriers of the heavily armored Shinano class would either serve as a support carrier or floating battle fortress at the frontline for the Combined Fleets battle line."
 JAP_scarrier_2:0 "Taihō Kai Class CVB II"
 JAP_scarrier_2_desc:0 "The Taihō Kai is an improved design of the former Taiho Class with better armor and flight deck protection and has a bigger aircraft group. These were the results from the analysis of the sinking of the IJN Taiho in 1944. The better armor and structural improvements in the hangar sections and the bow caused a slight drop in speed but made the design the most modern and deadly aircarft carrier design of the Imperial Japanese Navy even succeeding the glorious Shokaku Class aircraft carriers."
 JAP_lcarrier_1:0 "Hosho Class CVL I"
 JAP_lcarrier_1_desc:0 "The Hosho (literally "Phoenix in flight") aircraft carrier was the worlds first purpose built aircraft carrier in times of increasing interest in naval aviation. Commissioned in 1922, the ship was used for testing carrier aircraft operations equipment, techniques, such as take-offs and landings, and carrier aircraft operational methods and tactics. The ship provided valuable lessons and experience for the IJN in early carrier air operations. Hosho aircraft group consists of 25 aircrafts. Due to its slow speed and weak design it was used mainly as aircraft ferry and as atraining carrier for new pilots before they are sent to the Combined Fleets aircraft carrier for combat."

 JAP_lcarrier_1c_desc:0 "The Zuihō class was a group of two aircraft carriers built for the Imperial Japanese Navy before World War II, its lead ship Zuihō ("Auspicious Phoenix") and Shōhō ("Happy Phoenix"). Both ships were originally built as submarine tenders, but were subsequently converted into carriers. They were designed to operate 30 aircraft and its moderate speed made them a good all-around light carrier. The Zuihō class carriers saw extensive service during the first years of the pacific war. Both ships were assigned to the 4th carrier division of the Imperial Japanese Navy."

 JAP_lcarrier_4_desc:0 "Late in 1944 the IJN ordered a final light carrier design that should take into account the experience made in the pacific theater and take into account the latest improvements in carrier technology. This design resulted in the codename G18 project. A fast light carrier with huge range and a big aircraft group of 45 aircrafts. One of the design goals was to build the The G-18 Class in mass production, therefore it was easy and cost efficient designed. Its weak anti aircraft armament was compensated by its bigger aircraft group."
