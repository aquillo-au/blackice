The Wakatake class was the last class to be rated "second class" and all future destroyers were designed larger. The Wakatake-class destroyers were essentially slightly modified Momi-class ships with a deeper draft to improve handling characteristics in heavy seas, particularly against rolling.

 JAP_destroyer_6:0 "Mutsuki Class DD"
 JAP_destroyer_6_desc:0 "The Mutsuki-class destroyers were an improved version of the Kamikaze class destroyers and were ordered under the 1923 fiscal budget. The Mutsuki-class destroyers were based on the same hull design as the previous Kamikaze class, except with a double curvature configuration of the bow, a feature which became a standard in all later Japanese destroyers. The Mutsuki class was the first to be fitted with the newly developed 24-inch (610 mm) torpedoes, with greater range and larger warhead than previous torpedoes in the Japanese inventory."
 JAP_destroyer_7:0 "Fubuki Class DD"
 JAP_destroyer_7_desc:0 "The Fubuki class was ordered under the 1923 fiscal year budget, with ships completed between 1926 and 1931. Their performance was a great improvement over previous destroyer designs, so much so that they were designated Special Type destroyers. The large size, powerful engines, high speed, large radius of action, and unprecedented armament gave these destroyers the firepower similar to many light cruisers in other navies."
 JAP_destroyer_8:0 "Akatsuki Class DD"
 JAP_destroyer_8_desc:0 "The Akatsuki vessels had larger boilers and a narrower fore funnel than the previous Fubukis, and internally the number of boilers was reduced from four to three due to improvements in boiler design and efficiency. Other improvements over the Fubuki class included a splinter-proof torpedo launcher-turret, which allowed the torpedo launcher tubes to be reloaded in action."
 JAP_destroyer_9:0 "Hatsuharu Class DD"

They were to be armed much as the Fubuki class despite displacing only 1400 tons compared to the 1700 tons of the earlier destroyers. Furthermore, their fire control systems were to be more modern than the older systems and suitable for anti-aircraft use."

 JAP_destroyer_10_desc:0 "The initial six Shiratsuyu-class destroyers were modified versions of the Hatsuharu class, and had been originally planned as the final six vessels of that class under the Circle One Naval Expansion Plan. As with the Hatsuharu class, the Shiratsuyu-class destroyers were designed to accompany the Japanese main striking force and to conduct both day and night torpedo attacks against the United States Navy as it advanced across the Pacific Ocean, according to Japanese naval strategic projections. Despite being one of the most powerful classes of destroyers in the world at the time of their completion, none survived the Pacific War.

 JAP_destroyer_12:0 "Kagerō Class DD"
 JAP_destroyer_12_desc:0 "The Kagerō class was an enlarged and improved version of the preceding Asashio class. At the time of introduction, these destroyers were among the most deadly destroyers afloat, primarily due to the excellent range and lethality of its "Long Lance" torpedo. Only the lack of radar hindered their otherwise superb design. As with most pre-World War II ships, Kagerōs were also deficient in anti-submarine and anti-aircraft weaponry as designed."
 JAP_destroyer_13:0 "Akizuki Class DD"
 JAP_destroyer_13_desc:0 "The Akizuki class destroyers were well-armed with both surface guns and torpedoes, adequate AA armament, as well as much needed extra depth charges.

It was a prototype destroyer to test out new high-temperature, high-pressure turbines. It was extremely fast and heavily armed with torpedoes, but this meant a smaller radius of operations."
 JAP_destroyer_16:0 "Fuyutsuki Class DD"
 JAP_destroyer_16_desc:0 "The Fuyutsuki subclass were originally going to be built to the same specifications as the Akizuki class but construction was more simplified. Four vessels were built under the Maru KyÅ« Programme. Main differences from the Akizuki class were simplified bow design, removed rear deck house, and fitted two-dimensional air inlet for boilers."
 JAP_destroyer_17:0 "Matsu Class DD"
 JAP_destroyer_17_desc:0 "The Matsu class were built late in World War II, and they were intended to be more cost-effective in response to the changing character of naval warfare at that time. These ships were lighter and smaller than previous Japanese destroyers, with different armament such as enhanced anti-aircraft guns and anti-submarine weapons, and radar. Since surface warfare was believed to be less likely at this stage of the war, armament such as torpedo tubes that would be useful against surface ships was reduced."
 JAP_destroyer_18:0 "Michitsuki Class DD"
 JAP_destroyer_18_desc:0 "Final production model of the Akizuki class even more simplified design version of Fuyutsuki class and fast and cheap in production. The Michitsuki featured the most heavy anti aircraft armament fitted on a destroyer design within the Imperial Japanese Navy."
 JAP_destroyer_19:0 "Tachibana Class DD"

 JAP_light_cruiser_8_desc:0 "The design for the Agano class was based on technologies developed by aboard the cruiser Yūbari, resulting in a graceful and uncluttered deck line and single smokestack. Unlike most Japanese designs, the Agano class was not overweight, so it exhibited good stability and seaworthiness. The Agano class was unique among Japanese cruisers in that its main armament could elevate to 55 degrees, but this was still not enough to make them effective as anti-aircraft weapons."

Although the United States Navy planned to arm its Colorado class with 16-inch (406 mm) guns before the Nagato class was designed, Nagato's 410-millimeter (16.1 in) guns made her the first dreadnought that was launched armed with guns larger than 15 inches (381 mm). During their 1934-36 reconstruction, the ships' sterns were lengthened by 7.55 meters (24.8 ft) to improve their speed and their forward superstructures were rebuilt into a pagoda mast.
