 ### Pre-war naval technology (largely WW1)
 battleship_pdn:0 "Pre-Dreadnought"
 battleship_pdn_desc:0 "Pre-Dreadnoughts hearken back to the late 19th and early 20th century, before the lessons of the Battle of Tsushima led to capital ships having one size of main armament, and increasing substantially in speed and size. However, while slow, these vessels still have armament that can be dangerous to anything smaller than a modern battleship."
 battleship_dn:0 "Dreadnought"
 battleship_dn_desc:0 "The first couple of generations of Dreadnoughts still have many things in common with more modern battleships, but tend to have smaller calibre guns, travel at slower speeds and be more lightly armoured."
 battleship_adv_dn:0 "Advanced Dreadnought"
 battleship_adv_dn_desc:0 "The naval arms races of the early 20th century and the First World War lead to rapid development in battleships, and some of the vessels laid down late in World War One were twice the size and considerably more capable than ships built less than ten years earlier."
 destroyer_tb:0 "Torpedo Boat Destroyer"
 destroyer_tb_desc:0 "Destroyers were originally built as counters to torpedo boats, dedicated torpedo delivery vessels.  However, it was soon found that these roles could be merged into a vessel carrying a number of small calibre guns and torpedoes, and thus the torpedo boat destroyer was born.  These vessels were significantly smaller than the destroyers that were developed over the course of the first world war, and those still in service in the 1930s had usually been often been reclassified as torpedo boats."
 destroyer_early_ww1:0 "Early WW1 Destroyer"
 destroyer_early_ww1_desc:0 "The pressures of wartime lead to rapid development in destroyers, which saw increases in size and armament (both gun and torpedo).  Speed also increased."
 destroyer_late_ww1:0 "Late WW1 Destroyer"
 destroyer_late_ww1_desc:0 "By the second half of World War One, destroyers had nearly reached or, in some cases, exceeded, 1000 tons displacement, and had 4inch or 4.7inch guns.  Most the vessels built during this stage of destroyer development were still in service at the outbreak of World War Two."
 light_cruiser_protected:0 "Protected Cruiser"
 light_cruiser_protected_desc:0 "A natural evolution of the frigate concept from the age of sail, the protected cruiser had a long range, reasonable armament and some degree of armour.  However, they were not powerful enough to stand up to the kind of vessels likely to be seen at the centre of a fleet action."
 light_cruiser_scout:0 "Scout Cruiser"
 light_cruiser_scout_desc:0 "The next evolution of the cruiser/scout/raider, scout cruisers were designed to either operate alone, protecting or attacking merchant shipping, or as the eyes of the fleet, scouting out enemy formations and reporting back to the battle line."
 light_cruiser_ww1:0 "WW1 Light Cruiser"
 light_cruiser_ww1_desc:0 "The First World War saw a rapid evolution in cruiser design, which saw a shift to a standard main armament, faster speeds and larger displacements.  Many of the later First World War light cruisers continued to give useful service in the Second World War."
 armoured_cruiser_1:0 "Armoured Cruiser 1"
 armoured_cruiser_1_desc:0 "Faster than the battleships of the day, but still relatively armoured and with more powerful guns than anything except a battleship, armoured cruisers could form the backbone of a local squadron, or part of the battle line, as needs required.  However, they were slow by the standards of modern cruisers, often reaching speeds of only 20 knots."
 armoured_cruiser_2:0 "Armoured Cruiser 2"
 armoured_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The last generation of armoured cruisers, these ships remained slower than the heavy cruisers that would follow them, but also remained more heavily armoured."
 heavy_cruiser_ww1:0 "WW1 Heavy Cruiser"
 heavy_cruiser_ww1_desc:0 "The first proper heavy cruisers were a natural progression from the light cruiser, and were a product of the naval design race between Britain and Germany in the First World War."
 battle_cruiser_early_ww1:0 "Early WW1 Battlecruiser"
 battle_cruiser_early_ww1_desc:0 "Battlecruisers were the faster and lightly armoured counterparts to the dreadnoughts, as the armoured cruisers had been to the pre-dreadnought battleships."
 battle_cruiser_late_ww1:0 "Late WW1 Battlecruiser"
 battle_cruiser_late_ww1_desc:0 "As was the case with the dreadnoughts, there were rapid advances in battlecruiser design from the ships in service at the start of the First World War to those that were commissioned towards the end.  These battlecruisers were larger and more capable, and started to blur the line between battleships and battlecruisers."
 carrier_ww1:0 "WW1 Carrier"
 carrier_ww1_desc:0 "The First World War saw the world's first aircraft carriers.  These vessels, while significantly smaller and slower than more modern carriers, still saw service in the 1930s and 1940s."
 submarine_ww1:0 "WW1 Submarine"
 submarine_ww1_desc:0 "Submarines had been part of the world's navies since around the turn of the century, but it was only in the First World War they became a serious threat.  While submarines of this period were very much dated by the start of World War Two, many navies still had a number of vessels of this vintage in service."
