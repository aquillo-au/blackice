The anti-aircraft version of the R4M used a large warhead of 55 mm with 520 g. of the strongly brisant Hexogen explosive charge, nearly guaranteeing a fighter kill with one hit, from the "shattering" force of its explosive warhead — this was the same explosive used in the shells fired by both the MK 103 and MK 108 autocannons. Each R4M weighed 3.2 kg and was provided with enough fuel to be fired from 1000 m, just outside the range of the bomber's defensive guns. The main body of the rocket consisted of a simple steel tube with eight base-hinged flip-out fins on the tail for stabilisation, deployed immediately after launch. A battery typically consisted of two groups of 12 rockets and when all 24 were salvoed in an attack, they would fill an area about 15 by 30 m at 1000 m, a density that made it almost certain that the target would be hit. The R4Ms were usually fired in four salvos of six missiles at intervals of 70 milliseconds from a range of 600 m, and would supersonically streak towards their target at a sixty percent higher velocity than the Wfr. Gr. 21's rockets would (the BR 21's projectile travelled at some 1150 km/h post-launch), as the R4M typically had a flight speed of roughly 1,890 km/h (1,175 mph). Two warheads were available for the R4M, the common PB-3 with a 0.4 kg charge for anti-aircraft use and the larger shaped charge, similar in construction to the Panzerschreck, the Panzerblitz (PB-2/3), for anti-tank use. The Panzerblitz III, mounting a gigantic 210 mm hollow charge warhead (the same calibre as the BR 21), can be seen as the ultimate development of the basic Orkan rocket.

 GER_vortex_cannon:0 "Vortex Cannon"
 GER_vortex_cannon_desc:0 "The Wind Cannon was developed by a factory in Stuttgart during the war. It was a type of gun that would eject a jet of compressed air against enemy aircraft. It was a strange device consisted of a large angled barrel like a bent arm resting in an immense cradle like some enormous broken pea-shooter lying askew. The cannon worked by the ignition of critical mixtures of hydrogen and oxygen in molecular proportions as near as possible. The powerful explosion triggered off a rapidly-ejected projectile of compressed air and water vapor, which, like a solid 'shot' of air, was as effective as a small shell. Experimental trials of the cannon at Hillersleben demonstrated that a 25mm-thick wooden board could be broken at 200m. Nitrogen peroxide was deployed in some of the experiments so that the brown colour would allow the path and destination of the otherwise transparent projectile to be observed and photographed. The tests proved that a powerful region of compressed and high-velocity air could be deployed with sufficient force to inflict some damage. However, the aerodynamics of a flying aircraft would almost surely have neutralized the effectiveness of this cannon. In addition, the effects of the cannon on a fast-flying aircraft was quite different from that on a fixed ground target. Still, the cannon was installed on a bridge over the Elbe, but with no significant results, either because there were no aircraft or simply no successes (as one might suspect). The wind cannon was an interesting experiment but a practical failure."
 GER_Sonic_Cannon:0 "Sonic Cannon"
 GER_Sonic_Cannon_desc:0 "During the early 1940s Nazi engineers had managed to develop a sonic cannon that could literally shake a person apart from the inside. Or at least that’s what they claimed. Designed by Dr. Richard Wallauschek, the cannon consisted of a methane gas combustion chamber leading to two large parabolic reflectors, the final version of which had a diameter over 3m. The 'dishes' were pulse detonated at around 44Hz and were connected to a chamber composed of several sub-units firing tubes. These tubes would allow a mixture of methane and oxygen in the combustion chamber, which when ignited, would turn these gases into noise that could kill. This infrasound, magnified by the dish reflectors, caused vertigo and nausea at 300 yards by vibrating the middle ear bones and shaking the cochlear fluid within the inner ear. Apparently, the sound waves created pressures that could kill a man 50 meters away in half a minute. To say the least, this is very unconvincing, since this supposed Sonic cannon was only tested on laboratory animals, and was never tested on human beings. Either or, in practice this thing would have been very vulnerable to enemy fire, since if the parabolic reflectors were damaged, it would render this weapon completely useless."

The tank was planned to be 1000 metric tonnes, being far heavier than the Panzer VIII 'Maus', the heaviest tank ever built (weighing 188 tonnes). The Ratte's primary weapon would have been a dual 280 mm SK C/28 gun turret. This was the same turret that was used on the German capital ship Gneisenau but modified by removing one of the guns and its associated loading mechanism. Removing the third gun allowed extra accommodation of ammunition, and reduced the total weight of the tank by 50 tonnes. The guns used for the Ratte would have fired ammunition developed for other naval guns. It also included armour-piercing rounds with 8.1 kg of explosive filler, and high-explosive rounds with 17.1 kg of explosive filler. Further armament was to consist of a 128 mm anti-tank gun of the type used in the Jagdtiger or Maus, two 15 mm Mauser MG 151/15 autocannons, and eight 20 mm Flak 38 anti-aircraft guns, probably with at least four of them as a Flakvierling quad mount. The 128 mm anti-tank gun's precise location on the Ratte is a point of contention among historians, most believing that it would have been mounted within the primary turret, with some others thinking a smaller secondary turret at the rear of the Ratte more logical. Some concept drawings exist to suggest a flexible mount on the glacis plate. The tank was to be provided with a vehicle bay that could hold two BMW R12 motorcycles for scouting, and several smaller storage rooms, a compact infirmary area, and a self-contained lavatory system. The project gained the approval of Adolf Hitler, who had expressed interest in the development of the tank, but was cancelled by Minister of Armaments Albert Speer in early 1943. The large size and weight would have rendered the tank unable to cross bridges at the risk of collapsing them, and travelling on roads would soon destroy them. Though its top intended speed was 40 kilometres per hour, its huge size and high visibility would have made it extremely vulnerable to aerial bombardment and artillery fire. Its great size would also have made it nearly impossible to transport—no existing railway or train car could bear its weight and its width was too great for existing tunnels."

The plan for a combat division made up of Hitler Youth members born in 1926 was passed on to Hitler for his approval. Hitler approved the plan in February and Gottlob Berger was tasked with recruiting. Fritz Witt of SS Division Leibstandarte (LSSAH) was appointed divisional commander."

Originally, the official mission of Ahnenerbe was to find new evidence of the racial heritage of the Germanic people; however, due to Himmler's obsession with occultism it quickly became his own occult tool and started using pseudoscience. The group was formerly called the Study Society for Primordial Intellectual history, German Ancestral Heritage (Studiengesellschaft fur Geistesurgeschichte‚ Deutsches Ahnenerbe), but it was renamed in 1937 as the Research and Teaching Community of the Ancestral Heritage (Forschungs- und Lehrgemeinschaft des Ahnenerbe)."

 GER_die_glocke:0 "Die Glocke"
 GER_die_glocke_desc:0 "Allegedly an experiment carried out by Third Reich scientists working for the SS in a German facility known as Der Riese (The Giant) near the Wenceslaus mine and close to the Czech border, Die Glocke is a device 'made out of a hard, heavy metal' approximately 2.7 metres wide and 3.7 to 4.6 metres high, having a shape like that of a large bell. According to an interview of Witkowski by Cook, this device ostensibly contained two counter-rotating cylinders which would be 'filled with a mercury-like substance, violet in colour'. This metallic liquid was code-named 'Xerum 525' and was 'stored in a tall thin thermos flask a meter high encased in lead'. Additional substances said to be employed in the experiments, referred to as Leichtmetall (light metal), 'included thorium and beryllium peroxides'. Witkowski describes Die Glocke, when activated, as having an effect zone extending out 150 to 200 metres. Within the zone, crystals would form in animal tissue, blood would gel & separate while plants would decompose into a grease like substance. Witkowski also said that five of the seven original scientists working on the project died during the tests. Based upon certain external indications, Witkowski states that the ruins of a concrete framework, aesthetically dubbed 'The Henge', near the Wenceslas mine, some 3.1 kilometres southeast of the main Complex Sokolec underground works of Project Riese, may have once served as a test rig for an experiment in 'anti-gravity propulsion' generated with Die Glocke. However, the derelict structure itself has also been interpreted to resemble the remains of a conventional industrial cooling tower. Witkowski’s statements along with Cook’s views prompted further conjecture about the device from various American authors, including Joseph P. Farrell, Jim Marrs, and Henry Stevens. In his book, Hitler's Suppressed and Still-Secret Weapons, Science and Technology (2007), Stevens concludes that the violet mercury-like substance described by Witkowski could only be red mercury because normal mercury 'has no fluid compounds according to conventional wisdom'. Stevens presents a story attributed to German scientist Otto Cerny as told to then 13-year-old Greg Rowe around 1961 which alleged that a concave mirror on top of a device which seemed similar in description to Die Glocke provided the ability to see 'images from the past" during its operation.'"

 GER_Goerings_art_desc:0 "Hermann Göring’s personal art log is a twisted treasure map, a guide to looting and pillaging and gift-giving among the Nazi brass, and a tracking mechanism for the Nazi occupation of Europe. It has long been known that Göring was among the most zealous of Nazi art collectors: at the end of the war, he packed the booty stored at Carinhall into trains and fled south toward Berchtesgaden, in Bavaria, he blew up Carinhall behind him. The collection was discovered by Allied soldiers, and, in 1945, the New York Times pegged the worth of the works at two hundred million dollars (part of a slew of breathless American coverage, according to Nancy Yeide, the author of 'Beyond the Dreams of Avarice: The Hermann Goering Collection'). The catalogue of Göring’s art provides a perversely fascinating yardstick for the changing taste of a man known for personal eccentricities as well as horrifying brutality. The emphasis, at first, is on northern European Romanticism, along with the nude female form. But the collection shifts, becomes more expansive, and, occasionally, eschews the Nazi laws on so-called degenerate art to scoop up some of the modern greats. 'I fully admit I had a passion for collection,' Göring said on the witness stand at Nuremberg, with a 'vulpine' smile, according to Janet Flanner, who reported from the trial for The New Yorker.

In the plant, which was run by Steyr-Daimler-Puch, over half of all Panzer IV tanks were produced up until the end of World War II. Of the 8500 Panzer IV tanks produced by Germany during the war, around 4800 came from here. Under the German four-year plan, after the annexation of Austria, an armaments centre was created in Linz, which included, among other things, the manufacture of armour plates at the Upper Danube Ironworks for the Nibelungen works which was itself responsible for the final assembly of tanks. The latter resulted from plans from 1939 to build an arms factory at the railway junction town of Saint Valentin for 65 million Reichsmark. The official opening took place in 1942. When completed, the monthly production capacity was intended to be 320 tanks, but this was never achieved. Late in the war (early 1945), the factory was also used in the repair of tanks coming from the frontlines (which were only a few km away at that point). It is estimated that around 50 Panthers were repaired in Nibelungen Works"

The first two years of the third five-year plan proved to be even more of a disappointment in terms of proclaimed production goals. Still, a reported 12% to 13% rate of annual industrial growth was attained in the Soviet Union during the 1930s. The plan had intended to focus on consumer goods. The Soviet Union mainly contributed resources to the development of weapons, and constructed additional military factories as needed.

Over 50 defensive lines were constructed around Britain. After the coastal defences, the GHQ Line was the longest and most important, designed to protect London and the industrial heart of Britain and was Britain's last chance of defence. "

 ENG_beaverbrook_desc:0 "William Maxwell Aitken, 1st Baron Beaverbrook, During the Second World War, in May 1940, his friend Winston Churchill, the British Prime Minister, appointed Beaverbrook as Minister of Aircraft Production. With Churchill's blessing Beaverbrook overhauled all aspects of war-time aircraft production; he increased production targets by 15% across the board, took control of aircraft repairs and RAF storage units, replaced the management of plants that were underperforming, and released German Jewish engineers from internment to work in the factories. He seized materials and equipment destined for other departments and was perpetually at odds with the Air Ministry. His appeal for pots and pans 'to make Spitfires' was afterwards revealed by his son Sir Max Aitken to have been nothing more than a propaganda exercise. Still, a Time Magazine cover story declared, 'Even if Britain goes down this fall, it will not be Lord Beaverbrook's fault. If she holds out, it will be his triumph. This war is a war of machines. It will be won on the assembly line.' Under Beaverbrook, fighter and bomber production increased so much so that Churchill declared: 'His personal force and genius made this Aitken's finest hour.' Beaverbrook's impact on wartime production has been much debated but he certainly energised production at a time when it was desperately needed. However, it has been argued that aircraft production was already rising when Beaverbrook took charge and that he was fortunate to inherit a system which was just beginning to bear fruit. Air Chief Marshal Lord Dowding, Head of Fighter Command during the Battle of Britain wrote that 'We had the organization, we had the men, we had the spirit which could bring us victory in the air, but we had not the supply of machines necessary to withstand the drain of continuous battle. Lord Beaverbrook gave us those machines, and I do not believe that I exaggerate when I say that no other man in England could have done so.' "

THEY SHALL NOT PASS, The Battle of Cable Street was a major factor leading to the passage of the Public Order Act 1936, which required police consent for political marches and forbade the wearing of political uniforms in public.  This is widely considered to be a significant factor in the BUF's political decline prior to the Second World War. The Act banned the wearing of political uniforms in any public place or public meeting.  It also required police consent for political marches to go ahead.  The Act also prohibited organising, training or equipping an association of persons for the purpose of enabling them to be employed in usurping the functions of the police or of the armed forces of the Crown, or for the use or display of physical force in promoting any political object.\n\nThe Act had the indirect result of actually improving the stance of the BUF.  Their forced abandonment of paramilitary and armed tactics improved the party's relations with the police, and in making it more respectable increased the BUF appeal among traditionally conservative middle-class citizens who became the party's main base in the years after the Public Order Act 1936 was passed."

The inventor of the first such bomb was the British engineer Barnes Wallis, whose 'Upkeep' bouncing bomb was used in the RAF's Operation Chastise of May 1943 to bounce into German dams and explode underwater, with effect similar to the underground detonation of the Grand Slam and Tallboy earthquake bombs, both of which he also invented."

 ENG_Gurkha_focus:0 "Gurkha Battalions"
 ENG_Gurkha_focus_desc:0 "There were ten Gurkha regiments, with two battalions each making a total of twenty pre-war battalions. Following the Dunkirk evacuation of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) in 1940, the Nepalese government offered to increase recruitment to increase the total number of Gurkha battalions in British service to thirty-five. This would eventually rise to forty-three battalions. To achieve the increased number of battalions, third and fourth battalions were raised for all ten regiments, with fifth battalions also being raised for 1 GR, 2 GR and 9 GR. This expansion required ten training centres to be established for basic training and regimental records across India. In addition, five training battalions were raised, while other units were raised as garrison battalions for keeping the peace in India and defending rear areas. Large numbers of Gurkha men were also recruited for non-Gurkha units, and other specialised functions such as Para troops, signals, engineers, and military police. A total of 250000 Gurkhas served in 40 battalions, plus eight Nepalese Army battalions, plus Parachute, training, garrison, and porter units during the war, in almost all theatres. In addition to keeping peace in India, Gurkhas fought in Syria, North Africa, Italy, Greece and against the Japanese in the jungles of Burma, northeast India and Singapore.  They did so with considerable distinction, earning 2,734 bravery awards in the process and suffering around 32,000 casualties in all theatres."
