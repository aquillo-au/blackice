 GER_coastal_submarine_4:0 "Type IID CSS IV"
 GER_coastal_submarine_4_desc:0 "The Type IID had additional saddle tanks fitted to the sides of the external hull. These saddle tanks were used to accommodate additional diesel storage tanks. The diesel oil would float atop the saddle tanks and as the oil is consumed, sea water would gradually fill the tanks to compensate for the positive buoyancy. The range was nearly doubled to 3,450 nmi (6,390 km; 3,970 mi) at 12 knots (22 km/h; 14 mph) and enabled the Type II to operate for longer durations around the British Isles. A further development was the propellers were fitted with Kort nozzles, intended to improve propulsion efficiency. It displaced 314 tonsIt displaced 291 tons, 3x 533mm torpedo tubes and had 5 torpedoes or 1 torpedoes and 9 TMB mines. Sixteen were built between 1937 and 1940."
 GER_coastal_submarine_5:0 "Type XXIII CSS V"
 GER_coastal_submarine_5_desc:0 "The Type XXIII coastal boat was one of the most advanced submarine designs of World War Two, although it success was overshadowed by its much larger cousin, the Type XXI Elektroboat.\nThe development of the Type XXIII was given very high priority, with the emphasis on using existing well-tried components as much as possible. To reduce development time, Dr. Walter designed the new boat based on the previous Type XXII prototype. By June 30 1943, the initial design was ready and construction began in parallel at several shipyards in Germany, France, Italy and German occupied USSR. The lead contractor was Deutsche Werft in Hamburg."

 GER_patrol_submarine_0:0 "Type IA SS 0"
 GER_patrol_submarine_0_desc:0 "Launched in February 14 1936, the Type IA was the first U-boat to be designed under German specification and was the first to receive the Type designation. This design was considered a failure as it had poor sea worthiness, poor maneuverability and was mechanically unreliable. Only two were built, which after initial trials, it was decided to cancel further production of this class. Only 2 were build the U-25 and the U26."
 GER_patrol_submarine_1:0 "Type VIIA SS I"
 GER_patrol_submarine_1_desc:0 "The first of the Type VII class, the VIIA was rigorously compared against the Type IA in an effort to determine the production model to be used for the U-boat force. The Type VIIA was the victor, but it lacked behind in many desirable characteristics possessed by the Type IA. It was then decided to improve on the Type VIIA and use it as a basis for further development. Ten Type VIIAs were built, six by AG Wesser and four by Germania, which were launched between June 24 1936 and April 15, 1937."
 GER_patrol_submarine_2:0 "Type VIIB SS II"
 GER_patrol_submarine_2_desc:0 "An improved version of the Type VIIA, the VIIB had a slightly lengthened hull and larger saddle tanks. This enabled a bigger fuel capacity which increased the range from 4,300nm to 6,500nm. Superchargers were fitted to the diesel engines, increasing surface speed by about 1 knot. Torpedo capacity was also increased from 11 to 14 torpedoes – two were stored externally in pressure tight containers underneath the upper deck. To improve on maneuverability and the turning radius, twin rudders were fitted directly behind the propellers. This new twin rudder arrangement allowed the single stern torpedo tube to be brought inside the pressure hull, making internal reloads at sea possible. On the Type VIIA, the stern torpedo tube was situated externally, and could be reloaded only at port. A total of 24 Type VIIBs were commissioned."
 GER_patrol_submarine_3:0 "Type VIIC SS III"
 GER_patrol_submarine_3_desc:0 "The Type VIIC seagoing submarine was the workhorse of the German U-boat force, with 568 commissioned between 1940 and 1945. The ships displaced 770 tons and were armed with five 533mm torpedo tubes."
 GER_patrol_submarine_4:0 "Type VIIC/41 SS IV"
 GER_patrol_submarine_4_desc:0 "The Type VIIC/41 was the German response to counter the effectiveness of British ASW progress made in 1940/41. As British ASW weapons and equipment improved, depth charges were becoming more effective and accurate at finding submerged U-boats. The necessity to dive even deeper to evade depth-charge attacks was becoming increasingly important. In the Type VIIC/41, the crush depth was increased from 200m to 250m.In order to increase the crush depth, all non-essential equipment were removed and many others were replaced with newer, lighter material. The weight savings was used to increase hull thickness from 0.73in (18.5mm) to 0.83in (21mm), which increased the crush depth to 820ft (250m).\nThese modifications were considered minor and did not warrant a new sub-type number, hence it was indicated by adding a suffix “41”, indicating that the modification approval was given in the year 1941.\nA total of 88 Type VIIC/41 were commissioned."
 GER_patrol_submarine_5:0 "Type VIIC/42 SS V"
 GER_patrol_submarine_5_desc:0 "The Type VIIC/42 was a planned further improvement of the VIIC/41. A contract was placed for 165 of this new boat, but none were ever laid, let alone completed. This design would have housed an additional supercharger, increasing engine efficiency and surface range to 10,000nm. Surface speed would have increased by 1.6 knots to 18.6kt.\nThe pressure hull was both lengthened and increased in diameter to house additional equipment.\nHowever the most significant improvement of this design was for the material of the hull to be fabricated by armored quality steel. With the planned increase in thickness to 1.1in (28mm), the crush depth of this boat would have been an astonishing 1,640ft (500m)."
 GER_patrol_submarine_6:0 "Type VIIC/43 SS VI"
 GER_patrol_submarine_6_desc:0 "The Type VIIC/43 was a planned similar design to the VIIC/42, but with upgraded firepower. It was to house six bow and four stern torpedo tubes. This design was cancelled in May 1943."

 GER_lr_patrol_submarine_2:0 "Type IXC SS LRII"
 GER_lr_patrol_submarine_2_desc:0 "Fifty four Type IXCs were built. The main difference was an increased fuel capacity to 208 tons, resulting in an extended range from 8,700nm to 11,000nm. This subclass onward had two periscopes, both housed within the conning tower."
 GER_lr_patrol_submarine_3:0 "Type IXC/41 SS LRIII"

 GER_lr_patrol_submarine_4:0 "Type IXD1 SS LRIV"
 GER_lr_patrol_submarine_4_desc:0 "Only two Type IXD1s were built, U-180 and U-195. Their standard diesel engines were substituted with six Daimler Benz MB501 diesels, producing an output of 1,500hp each. Though the maximum range was somewhat reduced, this design could achieve a respectable top speed in excess of 20 knots. Considerable technical problems were encountered, including overheating and the emission of white exhaust smoke which was visible for miles. The unsatisfactory engines were removed and the original MAN engines were reinstalled. They were later converted to transport U-boats and could to carry up to 252 tons of cargo. In this configuration, the torpedo tubes were removed to provide additional cargo room. Both variants of the Type IXD1s were equipped with a Focke Achgelis, a rotary winged kite for making distant observations."
 GER_lr_patrol_submarine_5:0 "Type IXD2 SS LRV"
 GER_lr_patrol_submarine_5_desc:0 "Twenty eight Type IXD2s were built. In addition to their standard MAN diesel engines, this variant had two additional six cylinder diesels which could be used for cruising on the surface. They had additional fuel bunkers, giving them the exceptional range of 23,700nm – the longest range of any German attack U-boat. Like the IXD1, it was equipped with a Focke Achgelis kite."
 GER_lr_patrol_submarine_6:0 "Type XXI SS LRVI"
 GER_lr_patrol_submarine_6_desc:0 "Type XXI submarines, also known as 'Elektroboote', were the first submarines designed to operate primarily submerged, rather than as surface ships that could submerge as a means to escape detection or launch an attack. Its key features were its streamlined hull and conning tower and its large number of battery cells. It was among the largest of the German submarine classes, displacing over 1,620 tons. There were 118 ships commissioned between 1943 and 1945."

Based on traditional destroyer design, several project studies started in 1938 to develop a large destroyer of the size of a CL. Like most German CLs, those ships were planed to get a mixed propulsion system, geared turbines for high speed and diesel engines for long cruises. The first three ships (SP1, SP2, and SP3, formerly named Z40, Z41, Z42) were ordered in February 1941 at the Germania Shipyard in Kiel.
