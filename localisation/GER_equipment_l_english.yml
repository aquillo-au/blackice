While never replacing the latter, it served alongside it and the heavier Tiger tanks until the end of the war. The Panther's excellent combination of firepower, mobility, and protection served as a benchmark for other nations' late war and post-war tank designs, and it is regarded as one of the best tanks of World War II.

This design was considered a failure as it had poor sea worthiness, poor maneuverability and was mechanically unreliable. Only two were built, which after initial trials, it was decided to cancel further production of this class. Only 2 were build the U-25 and the U26."
 GER_patrol_submarine_1:0 "Type VIIA SS"

The Type VIIA was the victor, but it lacked behind in many desirable characteristics possessed by the Type IA. It was then decided to improve on the Type VIIA and use it as a basis for further development. Ten Type VIIAs were built, six by AG Wesser and four by Germania, which were launched between June 24 1936 and April 15, 1937."
 GER_patrol_submarine_2:0 "Type VIIB SS"
 GER_patrol_submarine_2_desc:0 "An improved version of the Type VIIA, the VIIB had a slightly lengthened hull and larger saddle tanks. This enabled a bigger fuel capacity which increased the range from 4,300nm to 6,500nm. Superchargers were fitted to the diesel engines, increasing surface speed by about 1 knot. Torpedo capacity was also increased from 11 to 14 torpedoes – two were stored externally in pressure tight containers underneath the upper deck. To improve on maneuverability and the turning radius, twin rudders were fitted directly behind the propellers. This new twin rudder arrangement allowed the single stern torpedo tube to be brought inside the pressure hull, making internal reloads at sea possible. On the Type VIIA, the stern torpedo tube was situated externally, and could be reloaded only at port. A total of 24 Type VIIBs were commissioned."

 GER_patrol_submarine_4_desc:0 "The Type VIIC/41 was the German response to counter the effectiveness of British ASW progress made in 1940/41. As British ASW weapons and equipment improved, depth charges were becoming more effective and accurate at finding submerged U-boats. The necessity to dive even deeper to evade depth-charge attacks was becoming increasingly important. In the Type VIIC/41, the crush depth was increased from 200m to 250m.In order to increase the crush depth, all non-essential equipment were removed and many others were replaced with newer, lighter material. The weight savings was used to increase hull thickness from 0.73in (18.5mm) to 0.83in (21mm), which increased the crush depth to 820ft (250m).\nThese modifications were considered minor and did not warrant a new sub-type number, hence it was indicated by adding a suffix “41”, indicating that the modification approval was given in the year 1941.\nA total of 88 Type VIIC/41 were commissioned."
 GER_patrol_submarine_5:0 "Type VIIC/42 SS"
 GER_patrol_submarine_5_desc:0 "The Type VIIC/42 was a planned further improvement of the VIIC/41. A contract was placed for 165 of this new boat, but none were ever laid, let alone completed. This design would have housed an additional supercharger, increasing engine efficiency and surface range to 10,000nm. Surface speed would have increased by 1.6 knots to 18.6kt.\nThe pressure hull was both lengthened and increased in diameter to house additional equipment.\nHowever the most significant improvement of this design was for the material of the hull to be fabricated by armored quality steel. With the planned increase in thickness to 1.1in (28mm), the crush depth of this boat would have been an astonishing 1,640ft (500m)."

Though the maximum range was somewhat reduced, this design could achieve a respectable top speed in excess of 20 knots. Considerable technical problems were encountered, including overheating and the emission of white exhaust smoke which was visible for miles. The unsatisfactory engines were removed and the original MAN engines were reinstalled. They were later converted to transport U-boats and could to carry up to 252 tons of cargo. In this configuration, the torpedo tubes were removed to provide additional cargo room.

Designed with three single guns aft and a twin gun in the bow, they were originally fitted with a single gun in the bow. Four of the eight ships of the class were later refitted with the twin turrets. A second group of seven destroyers were built to a slightly modified design with twin guns in the bow."
 GER_destroyer_2e:0 "Zerstörer 1936A Mob. DD"
 GER_destroyer_2e_desc:0 "When war broke out in 1939, planned new destroyer classes were cancelled and twelve additional 1936A vessels (Z.31 to Z.42, although the last three were to be cancelled) were ordered with slight modifications to speed construction and save materials. "Mob" stands for "Mobilmachung" (Mobilisation). The 150 mm twin turrets had been manufactured for planned, but never built, "O" class battlecruisers. In war service, the engines were more reliable than in earlier ships but at the end of the war, heavy corrosion was discovered."
 GER_destroyer_2f:0 "Zerstörer 1936B DD"
 GER_destroyer_2f_desc:0 "The Type 1936B class of destroyers was a class of five destroyers built for Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine between 1941 and 1942, of which only three - Z36, Z35, and Z43 - were commissioned and saw service. The Type 1936B destroyer class differed from the previous Type 1936A class in several ways.  These two twin turrets were removed and replaced with five single 15 cm (5.9 in) turrets along with more anti-aircraft defences."
 GER_destroyer_2g:0 "Zerstörer 1936C DD"
 GER_destroyer_2g_desc:0 "Five ships of this class were ordered in 1942 and 1943 (Z.46 - Z.50), all from A.G. Weser at Bremen; none were launched, just two were started - Z.46 and Z.47. his design was a response to the vulnerability to air attack of early German destroyers and would have used six new 128 mm Flak 40 guns (originally designed for the Luftwaffe) as dual purpose weapons in twin mountings. The number of smaller calibre anti-aircraft guns would have also been increased."
 GER_destroyer_2h:0 "Zerstörer 1942C DD"
 GER_destroyer_2h_desc:0 "The the Type 1942C destroyer was a production class of large, diesel powered destroyers. They were planned to have a revised armament, with six 128 mm Flak 40 dual purpose main guns, and an all-new anti-aircraft armament, with three 5.5 cm Gerät 58 intermediate calibre anti-aircraft guns and a close-in armament of 14 30 mm guns in seven twin mounts, with eight torpedo tubes."
 GER_destroyer_3:0 "Zerstörer 1944 DD"
 GER_destroyer_3_desc:0 "Although the first prototype of a diesel powered destroyer (Zerstörer 1942) was not completed, the development of the ship type continued. Several proposals were made which finally lead to the Zerstörer 1944 project. In addition to a heavy main armament, the ships had an increased Flak armament compared to its predecessors, including the new 5,5 cm AA gun."
 GER_destroyer_4:0 "Zerstörer 1945 DD"
 GER_destroyer_4_desc:0 "The 1945 destroyer project was a design proposal for a high speed destroyer of almost 40 knots. While never built was it one of the most prommising destroyer designs by the end of the war with strong anti-submarine warfare equipment and strong anti aircraft armament and main batteries."

 GER_light_cruiser_1:0 "Emden Class C"
 GER_light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "Emden was the first large warship built in Germany after World War I. She was laid down in 1921 and commissioned in 1925. The armament consisted of eight 150mm (5.9") guns in single turrets."
 GER_light_cruiser_1b:0 "Königsberg Class CL"
 GER_light_cruiser_1b_desc:0 "The Königsberg class, sometimes referred to as the K class, was a class of light cruisers of the German Reichsmarine and Kriegsmarine. The class comprised three ships named after German cities: Königsberg, Karlsruhe, and Köln, all built between 1926 and 1930. These ships were the first of the Reichsmarine with a modern cruiser design; their predecessor, Emden, was based on World War I-era designs. They were armed with a main battery of nine 15 cm (5.9 in) guns and with twelve 50 cm (20 in) torpedo tubes."
 GER_light_cruiser_2:0 "Leipzig Class CL"
 GER_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Leipzig-class light cruisers were built between 1928 and 1935 as improvements over the preceding Königsberg-class cruisers. They displaced over 8,100 tons, had adequate speed and range, and were armed with nine 15cm SK C/25 guns in their main armament."
 GER_light_cruiser_3:0 "M Class CL"
 GER_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The M-class cruisers were designed as scouts for commerce raiding squadrons. Six ships were ordered as part of Plan Z, with two being laid down before work was halted at the outbreak of the war. The main armament would have been eight 150mm guns in four twin turrets."
 GER_light_cruiser_4:0 "Q Class CL"
 GER_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Q-class cruisers were a modified M-class design. They were designed to be larger than the M-class with a heavier anti-aircraft armament and improved fire control."
 GER_light_cruiser_5:0 "Spähkreuzer Class CL"
 GER_light_cruiser_5_desc:0 "Although called Spähkreuzer - Reconnaissance Cruiser - those ships were basically large destroyers capable for Atlantic Operations. Based on traditional destroyer design, several project studies started in 1938 to develop a large destroyer of the size of a CL. Like most German CLs, those ships were planed to get a mixed propulsion system, geared turbines for high speed and diesel engines for long cruises. The first three ships (SP1, SP2, and SP3, formerly named Z40, Z41, Z42) were ordered in February 1941 at the Germania Shipyard in Kiel. In December of 1941, the engines for the next three ships (SP4, SP5, SP6) were  ordered too, but not the ships themselves."
 ### CA ###
 GER_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Admiral Hipper Class CA"
 GER_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Admiral Hipper Class heavy cruisers were the first heavy cruisers of the Kriegsmarine. Officially displacing 10,000 tons, in reality they displaced over 16000 tons. They were armed with eight 8" guns in four twin turrets, with a secondary battery of twelve 105mm guns."
 GER_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Prinz Eugen Class CA"
 GER_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "Officially part of the Hipper Class, the Prinz Eugen subclass incorporates many improvements, including a heavier anti air armament. Of the three ships in the subclass, only Prinz Eugen was completed. She participated in the sinking of HMS Hood during Operation Rheinübung. After the war, she was transferred to the United States and served as USS Prinz Eugen in the Able and Baker atomic bomb tests before sinking at the Kwajalein Atoll in 1946."
 GER_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Panzerschiff Class CA"
 GER_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "The P Class was a large heavy cruiser design, officially designated as Panzerschiff (Armored Ship) by the Kriegsmarine. Displacing almost 24,000 tons, they would have been 3,000 tons lighter but 55 meters longer than the U.S. New York-class battleships. The armament consisted of six 280mm guns in two triple turrets."
 ### PBB ###
 GER_pocket_battleship_1:0 "Deutschland Class PBB"
 GER_pocket_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Deutschland class was a series of three Panzerschiffe (armored ships), a form of heavily armed cruiser, built by the Reichsmarine officially in accordance with restrictions imposed by the Treaty of Versailles. The ships of the class, Deutschland, Admiral Scheer and Admiral Graf Spee, were all stated to displace 10,000 long tons (10,000 t) in accordance with the Treaty, though they actually displaced 10,600 to 12,340 long tons (10,770 to 12,540 t) at standard displacement. Despite violating the weight limitation, the design for the ships incorporated several radical innovations to save weight. They were the first major warships to use welding and all-diesel propulsion. Due to their heavy armament of six 28 cm (11 in) guns, the British began referring to the vessels as pocket battleships. The Deutschland-class ships were initially classified as Panzerschiffe or armored ships, but the Kriegsmarine reclassified them as heavy cruisers in February 1940."

 GER_battle_cruiser_1:0 "Ersatz Yorck Class BC"
 GER_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Ersatz Yorck class was a group of three battlecruisers ordered for the Imperial German Navy in April 1915. The name derived from the fact that the lead ship was intended as a replacement (German: ersatz) for the armored cruiser Yorck, lost to mines in 1914. They were a slightly enlarged version of the Mackensen-class battlecruiser, armed with 38 cm (15 in) guns as opposed to the 35 cm (13.8 in) weapons on the preceding design."
 GER_battle_cruiser_2:0 "O Class BC"
 GER_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "In 1939, the Kriegsmarine decided to replace three of the planned P-class cruisers with battlecruisers. This resulted in the O-class battlecruisers, armed with six 38cm (15") guns in three twin turrets. The ships were designed with a displacement of 35,400 tons and a top speed of 35 knots. Construction orders were given for the three ships of the class, but none were started."
 ### BB/SHBB ###
 GER_battleship_1:0 "Pre-dreadnought Deutschland Class BB"
 GER_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Deutschland class was a group of five pre-dreadnought battleships built for the German Kaiserliche Marine. The class comprised Deutschland, Hannover, Pommern, Schlesien, and Schleswig-Holstein and were built between 1903 and 1908. The Treaty of Versailles permitted Germany to retain several old battleships for coastal defense, including the four Deutschland-class ships. However, instead of being used as a coastal defense ship, Deutschland was broken up in 1920–1922. Hannover was to be converted into a target vessel, although this was never done. She was eventually broken up in 1944–1946. Schlesien and Schleswig-Holstein were the only two vessels of the class to see continued front-line service in the Reichsmarine and later the Kriegsmarine. Both ships saw limited duty during World War II, which was inaugurated by the firing of Schleswig-Holstein's main guns at the Polish fortress at Westerplatte. Near the end of the war the two ships were both sunk."
 GER_battleship_1a:0 "Scharnhorst Class BB (280mm)"
 GER_battleship_1a_desc:0 "The Scharnhorst-class battleships were the first modern battleships to be built for the Kriegsmarine. They were built as a response to the French Dunkerque-class battlecruisers, themselves a response to the German Deutschland-class Panzerschiffe (Pocket Battleships). The Scharnhorst class is armed with nine 283mm (11") guns in three triple turrets. Plans were made to up gun them with twin 380mm (15") guns, but with the outbreak of the war, this never happened."

 GER_battleship_1b:0 "Bismarck Class BB" 
 GER_battleship_1b_desc:0 "The two-ship Bismarck-class battleships were the largest warships built for the Kriegsmarine. The ships were designed in response to the new French battleships under construction, with a similar armament of eight 38cm (15") guns as the Richelieu Class, with four twin turrets as opposed to the two quad turrets of the Richelieus. Bismarck is famous for the sinking of the British battlecruiser HMS Hood in the Battle of the Denmark Strait, but was subsequently hunted down and sunk before reaching port."
 GER_battleship_2:0 "Schlachtschiff H39 BB"
 GER_battleship_2_desc:0 "The German Plan Z envisioned a force of ten battleships in order to challenge the naval power of the United Kingdom. The H-class was a series of designs for the six battleships needed to meet the demands of the plan. Two ships of the H39 design were laid down at the outbreak of World War II, but construction was halted as the war begun. Neither of the ships were officially named, but Hindenburg was speculated as a possible name for the lead ship of the class. Had the ships been completed, they would have been augmented Bismarck Class ships, with a main battery of eight 40.6cm (16") guns."
 GER_SH_battleship_1:0 "Schlachtschiff H41 BB"
 GER_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "The H41 design of battleships was an improvement over the previous H39 design. The design called for significantly stronger armor, strengthened torpedo bulkheads and protection for the ships rudder and propeller shafts. The main battery was upgraded to eight 42cm guns, larger than that of the proposed Lion Class battleships of the United Kingdom. As designed, these ships would have a displacement of almost 70,000 tons."
 GER_SH_battleship_2:0 "Schlachtschiff H44 BB"
 GER_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The H44 Class was the last of the H-series of Battleship designs.

The two ships were launched as Gneisenau and Potsdam in 1935 and operated in peacetime by Norddeutscher Lloyd. After the outbreak of war, the ships were requisitioned by the Kriegsmarine as transports, and in May 1942, plans were drawn up to convert them into aircraft carriers. The ships were not identical, but were similar enough in size to allow identical outfitting. Gneisenau and Potsdam were to be renamed Jade and Elbe, respectively. Once converted, the ships were intended to operate twelve Ju-87 Stuka dive bombers and twelve Bf-109 fighters."
