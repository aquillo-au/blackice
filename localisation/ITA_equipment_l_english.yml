 ITA_submarine_1:0 "Mameli Class"
 ITA_submarine_1_desc:0 "The Geoffredo Mameli class is a class of medium submarines of the Regia Marina launched between 1926 and 1928. They displaced just under 800 tons and had a diving depth of 100m. They were the basis for subsequent models such as the Pisani, Bandiera, and Squalo classes."

 #ITA_submarine_1c: "Sirena Class"
 ITA_submarine_2:0 "Perla Class"
 ITA_submarine_2_desc:0 "The Perla-class and Adua-class submarines were built in the 1930s. They were the third and fourth sub-classes of the 600 Series of submarines built by Italy. They were smaller than their predecessors, displacing just over 600 tons."
 #ITA_submarine_2b: "Marcello Class"
 ITA_submarine_3:0 "Marconi Class"

 #ITA_submarine_3b: "Plantino Class"
 ITA_submarine_4:0 "Pietro Calvi Class"
 ITA_submarine_4_desc:0 "The Pietro Calvi subclass involved only minor improvements over the preceding Flutto class, which was a class of medium-sized submarines. Only a handful were launched, as most hulls were captured by the Germans after the Italian armistice. A redesigned version of the Pietro Calvi was finally commissioned in 1961."

 ITA_destroyer_1c_desc:0 "Curtatone-class destroyers were the first destroyers to be built in Italy after the end of World War I and were the first destroyers to use twin gun mountings. The ships were originally ordered at the same time as the Palestro class destroyers, but were postponed due to steel shortages. They displaced just under 1,000 tons and mount four 102mm Schneider-Armstrong guns."

Five ships were completed in the second batch in 1941-42. The second batch displaced just over 1,9 tons and was armed with four 120mm Ansaldo guns. Only the AA differed between these two batches."

 ITA_destroyer_4_desc:0 "The Comandanti Medaglie d'Oro class were a group of destroyers planned for the Regia Marina but never launched by the time of the Italian Armistice. The ships were significantly larger than previous Italian destroyers, displacing nearly 2,100 tons. They were also armed with the larger, 135mm Ansaldo guns and had improved engines."
 ITA_light_cruiser_1:0 "Magdeburg Class"
 ITA_light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The cruisers Taranto and Bari were World War I-era cruisers obtained from Germany as reparations. Both displaced between 4,500 and 5,100 tons and were armed with German 150mm SK/45 guns."

 ITA_destroyer_leader_2_desc:0 "Capitani Romani light cruisers were essentially designed to outrun and outgun the large new French destroyers of the late 1930s. Twelve hulls were ordered in late 1939, but only three were completed before the Italian armistice in 1943. They were lightly armored and displaced only 3,700 tons, but were quite fast. They mount eight 135mm OTO/Ansaldo guns."

 ITA_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Trento Class"
 ITA_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The Trento class was a heavy cruiser design of the Regia Marina from the late 1920s. They were the first ships designed specifically to the limitations of the Washington Naval Treaty, which limited cruisers to 10,000 tons and 8 in. guns. The last ship of the class, the Bolzano, was an improved design launched in 1932."

 ITA_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "Project UP102"
 ITA_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Project UP102 is a hypothetical class of late-war heavy cruisers. It displaced about 14,000 tons, was well-armed with eight 203mm OTO/Ansaldo guns, and could keep up with most carriers and other capital ships."
 ITA_battle_cruiser_1:0 "Project 770"
 ITA_battleship_1:0 "Conte Di Cavour Class"
 ITA_battleship_1_desc:0 "The Conte Di Cavour class battleships were commissioned during World War I. They had 305mm Armstrong-Vickers guns, displaced 23,000 tons, and had a top speed comparable to other dreadnought-era battleships. Starting in 1933, the two remaining ships of the class underwent a serious redesign, improving their size, armament, and performance to be on par with the emerging 'fast' battleships of the time."
 ITA_battleship_2:0 "Caio Duilio Class"
 ITA_battleship_2_desc:0 "The Caio Duilio class of battleships were originally commissioned at the start of World War I. Both ships, however, underwent a complete redesign between 1937 and 1940. This model represents the redesign. The armament is upgraded to ten 320mm M1934 guns, the displacement is now 29,000 tons, and the speed is enough to classify them as a 'fast' battleship. "
 ITA_battleship_3:0 "Littorio Class"
 ITA_battleship_3_desc:0 "The Littorio class, also known as the Vittorio Veneto class, represented the most modern battleships used by Italy during World War II. They displaced over 40,000 tons and were very fast for their size. They formed the backbone of the Italian fleet."

 ITA_battleship_4:0 "Project UP41"
 ITA_carrier_1:0 "Aquila Class"
 ITA_carrier_1_desc:0 "The Aquila was a planned conversion of an ocean liner, the Roma. The conversion was to begin in 1941, but the project was never completed. If completed, the Aquila would displace 23,500 tons and would be comparable to the Japanese Hiyo class and the British Indomitable class carriers."
 ITA_light_carrier_1:0 "Sparviero Class"
 ITA_light_carrier_1_desc:0 "The Sparviero was also a planned conversion of an ocean liner, the Augustus. The conversion began in late 1942, but did not get far. Germany scuttled the ship upon its capture after the Italian armistice. The carrier would have displaced 30,400 tons, been fairly well-armored, and had a strong AA defense battery."
