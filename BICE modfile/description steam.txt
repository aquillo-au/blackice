Black ICE HOI IV Version 2.5

First up, make sure you subscribe to the GFX addon. This basically adds in all the event images for BICE. Due to workshop size limits we had to split this GFX aspect off from the main BICE.

BICE HOI IV is a huge and expansive work. If you played HOI3 BICE you will know what you are in for. If not, be warned BICE is not for the faint hearted. BICE tends to frighten casual players and takes a very dedicated and demands a serious and mature strategy gamer's attention.
To put it simply, BICE isnt for everyone. If you like high detail, complicated and multiple choices, options, and possibilities, BICE is for you.

Black ICE is a mod which aims to overhaul HOI IV in order to make a more immersive, historical, and challenging experience for the player.

BICE adds in a huge array of new equipment types, country specific armor, aircraft and ships for all the major nations.
National Focus trees have been worked on for all the majors and many of the minor nations, often thanks to other mods which have generously allowed BICE to use their NF trees.
Laws and politics are greatly expanded and allow for great detail in how you choose to run your nation.
We have also worked on and expanded the OOBs, templates, and production for all nations. Some techs will provide new units, some will provide upgrades and some will provide new equipment for existing units.
To help offset the costs of equipment specialised factories can be built such as tank factories, artillery factories, small arms factories etc. These map buildings will lower the cost of the associated equipment.
The AI is capable and fully functioning with all the techs, equipment and units where it makes sense in terms of gameplay and history.
